Mike Carson, an introvert and self-described indie hacker, shares his journey from building a successful domain-catching service to reviving the original social network.

## Background and Motivation

Carson grew up in a financially struggling family, which shaped his determination to succeed. "My family didn't have money," he explains, noting his father worked continuously while struggling with depression. This experience drove him to build profitable ventures.

## park.io Success

Carson developed park.io, a domain drop-catching service for alternative domain extensions like .io, .ly, and .ai. Starting as a side project, it grew to over $1 million annually before he sold it, allowing him to pursue passion projects without immediate revenue pressure.

## Current Projects

He's now developing two initiatives: Spaces Protocol, a Bitcoin-based decentralized identity system, and Friendster -- the original social network. Carson acquired the friendster.com domain after discovering it had expired, leveraging his connections from the domain-investing community.

## Philosophy on Growth and Success

Carson advocates against obsessive growth focus, emphasizing that "growth is fine if it comes naturally." He prioritizes happiness and product quality over expansion metrics. Regarding success itself, he argues that focusing excessively on achievement creates unnecessary stress and paradoxically hinders progress. Instead, he recommends building interesting products and allowing success to follow naturally.

## Friendster's Vision

The revived Friendster aims to recapture the internet's early social era, rejecting ad-driven monetization models. With hundreds of thousands on the waitlist, Carson envisions a positive community space distinct from modern social media's problematic dynamics.
