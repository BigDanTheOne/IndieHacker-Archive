Arian Adeli launched Evernomic, a venture studio operating 14 startups across media, publishing, community platforms, advertising technology, and creator tools. The company generates revenue through three primary channels.

## Revenue Streams

Advertising comprises six figures in annual campaigns through media brands and partner channels. Services -- including acquisitions, product development, content, and growth support -- generate the majority of current cash flow, though revenue remains less predictable. Product ventures contribute varying amounts, with some achieving five-figure monthly revenue while others operate in the four-figure range. Overall revenue distribution favors non-recurring revenue at roughly 60-40.

## Building Infrastructure

Adeli observed that startups waste resources reinventing foundational systems: go-to-market strategies, analytics, revenue models, and content pipelines. Evernomic was designed to address this inefficiency by creating flexible supporting infrastructure that accelerates new ventures rather than slowing them down.

## Strategic Moves

Within three months, the studio launched Signaal (a Dutch housing app), relaunched Comma (a personal website builder with improved design), and acquired Waitless (a waitlist builder being enhanced for viral referral campaigns).

## Technology Stack

Most products use Next.js, Vercel, Supabase, Resend, and Tailwind CSS. Python handles backend logic and API work. Beehiiv serves as the crucial media tool for newsletter operations.

## Growth Strategy

Initially bootstrapped without paid advertising, Evernomic relied on organic growth through newsletters, side projects, SEO, partnerships, and consistent content distribution. The studio leveraged owned newsletters to secure cross-promotional partnerships with similar-sized publications, directing placements toward product launches rather than newsletter promotion. Current spending allocates $20-50 daily across Meta and Google, with Meta proving more effective for newsletter acquisition while Google Ads drive higher-intent conversions.

## Critical Mindset Shift

Adeli acknowledged that consistency presents his greatest challenge, given his tendency toward working simultaneously on multiple projects. A pivotal realization emerged: building depth outperforms spreading resources thin. He shifted from "adding rooms to a bungalow" to "building a skyscraper" -- meaning focusing intensely on what works rather than chasing every interesting opportunity.

## Team and Vision

Surrounding himself with capable, aligned collaborators proved most valuable. Rather than attempting solo execution, Adeli built a lean team where everyone excels at their respective roles and shares the company vision.

## Recommendations for Founders

Avoid narrow focus on building alone. Recognize personal strengths while identifying missing capabilities -- whether through co-founders, support networks, or improved sharing and selling habits. Multi-dimensional thinking matters more than technical expertise alone.

## Future Plans

Evernomic is becoming more publicly visible as a brand, making explicit connections between the name and the portfolio developed over three years. Two stealth-mode startups approach launch readiness. The studio plans to release the Evernomic Review, a founder-focused publication featuring analytical content, insights, and deep dives from active company builders intended to help others replicate similar success.
