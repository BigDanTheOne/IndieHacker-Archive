Michal Kankowski transitioned from various jobs -- including horse hoof trimming and standup comedy -- to building Kickstart Side Hustle, a membership platform generating up to $6,000 monthly combined with fractional CMO services.

## The Concept

Frustrated by superficial marketing articles lacking substance, Kankowski created a platform diving into the mechanics of viral marketing. The site houses over 1,500 users and 6,000 newsletter subscribers, functioning as a comprehensive marketing library with hundreds of case studies and psychology principles focused on emotional conversion strategies.

## Building the MVP

Starting with just $55, Kankowski launched a basic newsletter using WordPress, Hostinger, and GetResponse's free trial. Validation took five days -- two for setup, three for testing. His current tech stack includes WordPress, Hostinger, EmailOctopus, Gumroad, and Pabbly.

## Growth Strategy

- **Product Hunt Launch (June 2020):** 800 subscribers in three days; $100 earned
- **Pivot (October 2020):** Evolved to annual membership at $50/year
- **Second Launch (January 2021):** Generated $10,000 in one week with pricing at $99-$449, enabling full-time transition
- **Ongoing Growth:** Influencer partnerships yielded $2,000-$15,000 per deal; cold outreach and consulting provided additional revenue

## Key Lessons

**Focus Strategy:** "Going where your consumers hang out" requires choosing one marketing channel and committing 1-2 months before pivoting.

**Time Management:** Theme-based calendar blocking prevents task-switching -- dedicating specific days to SEO, product development, or other priorities dramatically improves productivity.

**The Agency Trap:** Hiring external marketing after early success proved disastrous; the agency spent his entire budget misaligned with brand values, triggering a "desperation spiral" and emotional struggle.

**Mental State Matters:** Kankowski emphasizes emotional management, distinguishing between "abundance" and "lack" mindsets. Building 12 months of savings protects mental health during challenges.

## Advice for New Founders

1. Surround yourself with driven community members (Twitter, Reddit, Indie Hackers)
2. Study how successful founders validate ideas and acquire first 100 users
3. Seek mentor relationships with people in adjacent niches
4. Build savings equivalent to 10 months expenses before going all-in
5. Use calendar blocking for themed days
6. Focus on one strategy at a time with consistent execution
7. Evaluate and optimize daily approaches

## Revenue Breakdown

- Total lifetime revenue: $120,000
- Current monthly: $2,000-$6,000
- Freelance work: $500-$5,000 monthly
- Client base: Founders (53%), marketers (20%), freelancers (15%), primarily from SMBs (88%)

## Next Steps

Kankowski plans upgrading the psychology section's UX, doubling revenue through social media traffic increases, and continuing fractional CMO work for a mobile app client.
