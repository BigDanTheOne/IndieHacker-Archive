Dylan Redekop launched Growth Currency, a newsletter about newsletters, after pivoting from a broad marketing-focused publication. His strategic niche-down from 1,000 subscribers generated over $125k in total earnings through multiple revenue streams.

## Getting Started

Redekop began in 2020 without a defined niche, following the Substack trend. He curated content on marketing, tech, and finance using minimal resources: Webflow hosting and ConvertKit. Working remotely allowed flexible newsletter development alongside his day job.

## The Niche Pivot

After reaching 1,000 subscribers, community feedback from Jay Clouse's 'The Lab' encouraged focusing specifically on newsletters. Though initially concerning, the pivot generated "more content ideas, more positive feedback, and very few unsubscribed."

## Platform Selection

Redekop switched from Substack to Kit (ConvertKit) due to superior analytics and deliverability. Open rates improved from 43% to 55%. He uses Airtable for content curation and sponsorship management.

## Growth Strategy (Year 1-2)

- Reached 100 subscribers in 100 days organically
- Launched lead magnet; grew 7x in three months
- Achieved 1,000 subscribers by end of 2021
- Launched website in May 2022
- Reached 2,600 subscribers by year-end 2022

Growth tactics included Twitter thread repurposing, newsletter cross-promotions, lead magnets, and earned media placements.

## Revenue Streams

1. **Ad Spots:** Started with Swapstack at 600 subscribers ($25 per ad), progressed to ConvertKit Sponsor Network (earning nearly 2x per spot despite 20% commission)
2. **Sponsorships:** Early partnership generated $600 for 10 sponsored issues
3. **Consulting:** Approximately $5,000 from one-off projects
4. **Affiliate Marketing:** Around $2,000 promoting Kit
5. **Opportunities:** Over $100k from contract work and employment opportunities connected through the newsletter

## Monetization Advice

Redekop emphasizes starting monetization early and diversifying revenue. "The most successful ones had at least two revenue streams, but more often they'd have three or even five" different income sources.

## Technical Content Guidance

For newsletter success, Redekop recommends avoiding middle-ground niches. Instead, choose hyper-niche angles (e.g., "AI Prompt newsletter for marketers") or extremely broad appeal like Morning Brew.

Onboarding requires channel-specific approaches. Subscribers from pop-up widgets need reminders about signup origin and immediate unsubscribe options to prevent spam reports.

## Hiatus and Restart

After joining SparkLoop in spring 2023, Redekop paused publishing due to burnout. Restarting in Q3-Q4, he generated approximately $500 monthly -- far below previous earnings. He now prioritizes feeling and emotion over formal goals.

## Key Learnings

Don't wait for perfection before launching. Redekop had no followers, email list, or website initially. "Just start the thing."
