Ben Aston started with a simple blog and built a media tech powerhouse. Now, Black & White Zebra's products generate $21M+ annually.

## Starting with Satire

Aston launched his first online publication in 2001 while in high school -- a satirical student site called Seuch Times. He created content, built an audience, and monetized through t-shirt sales. After a decade managing digital projects at London agencies, he relocated to Vancouver and started a blog about digital project management as a side project.

The blog became The Digital Project Manager, eventually forming the foundation for Black & White Zebra (BWZ), a bootstrapped, profitable company with 15+ niche media brands, millions of monthly visitors, and strong audience trust.

## Living the Market Gap

Aston identified a clear pain point: as a digital project manager in London during the early 2010s, he struggled finding practical guidance. "The role was new, the industry was evolving fast, and I was constantly Googling for help... but finding nothing."

His audience revealed another gap -- practitioners wanted focused, high-trust content. As the audience grew, Aston recognized a bigger opportunity: building professional brands supporting people through content, community, and tools.

## Building on Simple Foundations

The publishing platform uses WordPress as the CMS, MemberPress for memberships, Gravity Forms for lead capture, and OptinMonster for conversion optimization. Zoho powers internal operations, and HubSpot serves as the core CRM and marketing automation layer.

Aston built proprietary AdTech (Revleads) and PubTech (Revstacks) platforms in-house to solve problems the company faced as a media company. These custom tools include a proprietary bidding engine, campaign manager, reporting dashboards, and contextual placement tools.

## Focus on Tech, Not Content

For years, Aston believed his company was purely content-driven. However, building an in-house tech team proved transformative. "Once we finally built an in-house tech team, everything changed -- faster development, tighter alignment, and a real product mindset."

## Monetizing Trust

Initial monetization started with content -- tactical, real-world advice. As trust grew, the company expanded to affiliate links, then ads, then community memberships. The approach emphasized relevance: "the response wasn't 'ugh, another ad.' It was, 'Oh good, I was looking for a tool like this.'"

Aston built proprietary adtech to offer performance-based ad buying (Revleads) and monetization infrastructure (Revstacks), allowing the company to control audience relationships and create genuinely useful ad experiences.

## Audience-First Growth

The company grew through organic, audience-first strategies rather than paid advertising. Key tactics included:

- **Evergreen content**: Job-relevant articles like "project kickoff checklist" consistently rank in search and drive thousands of monthly sessions
- **Community feedback loops**: Paid community members highlight gaps, informing content strategy
- **Platform expansion**: YouTube channels and podcasts repackaged high-performing topics
- **User-led expansion**: Brands like People Managing People and The Product Manager launched in response to search data and audience conversations

Launched brands include The CFO Club, The CMO Club, and The CRO Club. The ecosystem became a magnet for B2B SaaS vendors like Monday.com, Smartsheet, and Zoho, who sought access to large, engaged, high-intent audiences.

## Scaling Issues

During COVID, rapid scaling created challenges. The company expanded headcount but lacked sufficiently senior leadership. "We were trying to scale before stabilizing the foundation." This period resulted in content misalignment with user intent, causing revenue to drop nearly a third.

The recovery required returning to core principles: audience insight and delivering real value. Aston became more involved in frontline work to ensure strategic alignment.

## Growing Revenue

The business model rests on three pillars:

1. **Advertising** via Revleads proprietary AdTech
2. **Publisher monetization** through Revstacks PubTech
3. **Professional development** through courses and paid memberships

Revenue growth came from creating content across more verticals, improving monetization infrastructure, expanding vendor real estate, and building community layers including paid memberships and cohort-based training.

## Parting Advice

**Build brand early**: Quality alone isn't enough; people must know you're good.

**Be valuable and specific**: Execution matters more than ideas. The approach involves setting vision, defining success, working backward, breaking into steps, and maintaining momentum.

**Don't be a copycat**: Aston's non-media background became an advantage, allowing him to solve problems without industry constraints.

**Build trust before revenue**: Most growth came from useful, honest relationships. Major advertisers came inbound after seeing BWZ help their future customers.

**Hold strong opinions lightly**: Maintain conviction while remaining humble and willing to evolve based on learning.

## What's Next

Goals focus on expanding impact, deepening value, and making professional growth more accessible:

1. Expand Revstacks into creator economy
2. Make serious professional content fun
3. Build the most-loved professional development ecosystem in digital media
4. Turn audience trust into intelligence at scale
5. Help SaaS vendors and publishers win efficiently
