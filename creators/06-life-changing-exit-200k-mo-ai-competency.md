Joshua Wohle started his first company at 16 and founded SuperAwesome, which became one of the world's largest kids' technology platforms before being acquired by Epic Games. He then pivoted into education, investing in approximately 50 companies as an angel investor while founding Mindstone about five years ago.

When ChatGPT emerged 2.5 years ago, Wohle repositioned Mindstone to focus entirely on generative AI, building what he describes as "the largest practical AI community in the world." The company now serves major organizations including Hyatt Hotel Corporation, Pearson, and EBSCO, offering an AI Competency Program that takes just 10 hours delivered over four weeks. Wohle reports the program typically doubles AI usage within participating companies, with revenue exceeding $200,000 monthly as of his interview date.

## Key Insights

He emphasizes that most people don't inherently love learning -- they pursue it to achieve specific goals. This realization fundamentally changed Mindstone's approach from inspiring passion for education to helping people reach concrete objectives.

Regarding product development, Wohle notes that after three years of platform building, the company finally achieved product-market fit by adopting a hybrid live-asynchronous model, contradicting his earlier SaaS assumptions that scaling should require minimal human involvement.

On strategy and vision, Wohle advocates against consensus-driven decision-making: "Instead of leaning into consensus, I would lean into a particular direction and double down on it." He credits this clarity with enabling better market messaging, faster product-market fit achievement, and more effective team management.

## Community Building

Community building proved transformative. What began as small demo gatherings with friends evolved into a worldwide network with regular meetups across London, Lisbon, Madrid, Amsterdam, Berlin, Helsinki, Paris, Milan, Toronto, New York, and Boston. This community became the primary growth engine for Mindstone.

## Technology

Mindstone uses Google Cloud, with backend development in Go and frontend work in JavaScript, progressively transitioning toward AI-first development stacks like Replit.

## Future Vision

Wohle frames the AI era as presenting two potential futures: one where automation causes job losses and societal disruption, and another where people gain skills to harness AI for personal benefit. He positions Mindstone's mission as steering society toward the latter scenario through education and practical skill development.
