Ben Issen founded Side School, an online educational platform teaching practical AI skills through challenge-based learning. The bootcamp generated over six figures in revenue within three months of launch.

## Background and Path to Side School

Issen grew up in an entrepreneurial environment and became Webflow's first intern at 18. He subsequently founded Supercreative, a personal incubator building tools for freelance designers. Over four years, he designed, coded, and marketed 18 tools, selling eight of them to acquire.com and Twitter-based acquirers.

## Founding Side School

Frustrated with traditional education models, Issen partnered with co-founder Zineb Salamat, who had previously launched six online schools. Together they built Side School in just four weeks using no-code tools including ChatGPT, Framer, Discord, Whimsical, and Figma.

## The Lean Approach

The team prioritized rapid validation over polished execution. They launched "AI for Designers" as their first bootcamp after minimal development time. Participants reported transformative experiences, validating their approach early.

## Revenue Model and Growth

Monthly bootcamps cost $1,400 per person. The company approached nearly 350 students, focusing initially on French markets before expanding to Europe and North America. Enterprise offerings include internal bootcamps and subscription seat options.

## Distribution Strategy

While Issen initially experimented with cold outreach, social campaigns, and partnerships without consistent results, the company eventually found success through:

- Word-of-mouth and Supercreative network leverage
- Social media case studies
- Sales-driven growth via LinkedIn outreach targeting SMBs
- Free challenges allowing skill testing before enrollment

The team employs two dedicated sales professionals managing enterprise relationships.

## Key Operational Tools

The platform utilizes Notion, Tally, Whereby, Customer.io, Google Tag Manager, Supabase, Motor Admin, Krea, V7 Go, and Lindy -- many described as "hidden gem" AI tools comparable to Webflow's early positioning.

## Philosophy and Future Direction

Issen credits his "hyper-freelance model" approach -- progressing from freelancing to education to product building -- as foundational. He recommended books like "Founding Sales" and "Disciplined Entrepreneurship" for aspiring founders.

Looking ahead, he remains focused on answering: "How do we create better systems to learn online?"
