Stephen Walker founded Product Strategy, a newsletter about product management that generates $10,000 monthly revenue through subscriptions and workshops. With 75,000 subscribers built over four years, Walker shares his approach to building a sustainable creator business.

## Motivation and Origins

Walker began the newsletter after losing his internal work documentation when changing companies. He wanted to preserve his thinking about product management strategy, challenges, and wins. His advice: document your work while employed -- it creates valuable notes and provides perspective on your thinking over time.

## Business Model

The Product Strategy operates as a freemium newsletter with a paid membership tier offering additional content and tools. Revenue also comes from workshops covering product strategy and AI strategy topics. Walker simultaneously builds Klu.ai, an LLM application platform for evaluating and optimizing across model providers.

## Building Consistency

Walker identifies procrastination as his greatest challenge. He recommends "The War of Art" by Steven Pressfield for addressing creative resistance. His solution involves updating self-image: "I am someone who writes daily" rather than relying on motivation.

## Writing Approach

He emphasizes quantity over perfection, writing mornings and weekends, editing Sundays. Many pieces never publish. Writers Safi Bahcall and Steven Pressfield influenced his philosophy. Bahcall's concept of "Write FBR" (fast, bad, wrong) resonates -- major works from Star Wars to Hemingway novels improve through editing rather than initial composition.

## Growth Strategy

Initial growth came from closing in-person talks with links to his site. Walker advocates speaking with potential users early to assess genuine interest and identify ideal customers. He recommends "The Mom Test" for gathering unbiased feedback.

## Key Lessons

**Nothing happens overnight:** The transition from zero to one subscriber took weeks. Growth compounds gradually.

**Share across channels:** Direct traffic from any platform to your core offering. "Curious tourists" eventually develop sustained interest.

**Product-market fit matters:** Reaching audiences misaligned with your offering produces poor results.

## Missed Opportunities

Early cold outreach attempts led to collaboration proposals Walker declined. He reflects: missing opportunities often stems from insufficient hunger or overconfidence.

## Technical Setup

Walker hosts everything independently using Ghost on DigitalOcean, avoiding WordPress complications. He emphasizes that modern LLM-powered editors eliminate technical barriers to starting.

## Starting Advice

Begin immediately with an MVP and charge from day one. Sales addresses real customer problems. For scaling, the Microsoft for Startups Founder Hub provides free Azure credits and OpenAI model access.

Balance two tradeoffs: find cheap setups that don't diminish quality of life initially, then optimize for quality of life at lower cost when scaling.

## Future Plans

Walker focuses primarily on Klu.ai with his cofounder, developing evaluation tools called QUAKE. Video content from workshop materials is planned for 2025.
