Mubashar Iqbal, a 49-year-old founder, recently transitioned to full-time indie hacking after building 120 side projects over 20+ years. He holds the Product Hunt record with 85 launches and currently operates a product studio generating $10k monthly.

## Background

Iqbal's coding journey began at age eight when his family acquired a computer. He taught himself programming through computer magazines and later studied computer science formally, but maintained his passion for building personal projects throughout a decades-long tech career at a fintech startup.

## Current Projects

His active products include GuestLab (AI research assistant, ~$100 MRR), MicroAssets (bootstrapped project marketplace, $300+ MRR), Once.Tools (software database, pre-revenue), and SideprojectMVP (newsletter, pre-revenue). All operate on a bootstrap model with zero advertising spend.

## Development Philosophy

Iqbal emphasizes building working MVPs quickly -- typically within 2-4 weeks. He uses the TALL stack (Tailwind, AlpineJS, Laravel, Livewire) with Herd for local development, Forge for server provisioning, and Cloudflare for infrastructure. He argues that "validating an MVP, not an idea" proves far more effective than pre-launch validation.

## Simultaneous Project Management

He manages multiple projects through natural workflow cycles, rotating focus between products while maintaining minimal contact on others. Linear handles task management; Google Docs or notepads organize initial project visions.

## Growth Strategy

His marketing approach follows: building in public on social media, launching on platforms (Product Hunt, Hacker News, subreddits), implementing SEO and programmatic tactics, building mailing lists, then scaling. His 17k-follower audience drives most organic growth.

## Service Business Model

His product studio leverages warm outreach rather than cold email. He emphasizes relationship-based networking: "You've gotta do things that don't scale." This approach yielded $10k monthly revenue while maintaining equity partnerships and revenue-sharing arrangements.

## Audience Development

Iqbal credits audience building as essential to his success. By sharing progress, failures, and learnings transparently, he built engagement and attracted target users organically. He maintains curated lists of relevant creators and actively engages with their work.

## Core Advice

His parting recommendation: "Start now." He acknowledges that early projects typically underperform, but consistent building develops competence over time.
