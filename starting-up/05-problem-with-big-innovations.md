## The Multiple

History reveals a fascinating pattern called "the multiple" -- when multiple people independently invent the same thing or make identical discoveries without knowledge of each other's work. Examples include Newton and Leibniz developing calculus in the 1670s, Scheele and Priestley discovering oxygen in the 1770s, and Edison and Swan inventing practical light bulbs in the 1870s.

This phenomenon isn't anomalous but rather commonplace. Sociologists have documented that most major breakthroughs across millennia trace back to several disconnected people worldwide. Even agriculture itself represents a multiple, emerging independently in five or six locations roughly 11,000 years ago.

## Understanding Innovation

Innovation fundamentally involves combining existing components in new ways. As the Roman poet Lucretius observed nearly 2,000 years before atomic theory: "when atoms combine differently, entirely new configurations emerge." Water (H2O) exemplifies this -- hydrogen and oxygen atoms arranged distinctly create something novel.

True innovation produces useful new configurations that enable previously impossible tasks. Each innovation becomes a new spare part expanding what's "adjacent possible" -- the space of potential future combinations.

## The Adjacent Possible

Steven Johnson describes this concept brilliantly: "Each new combination ushers new combinations into the adjacent possible. Think of it as a house that magically expands with each door you open."

## Why Multiples Occur

Innovation multiples don't happen randomly; prior developments make them possible. Consider:

- **Calculus:** Newton and Leibniz accessed the ancient "method of exhaustion," recently formalized by Bonaventura Cavalieri in 1647
- **Oxygen:** Scientists possessed new tools like bell jars and advanced heating techniques
- **Light bulbs:** Incandescent technology existed; Edison and Swan merely improved filament durability using carbon
- **Agriculture:** The Holocene climate shift made farming viable after 200,000 years of ice-age conditions

As Newton himself acknowledged: "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants."

## Macro vs. Micro Innovation

The article distinguishes between two innovation categories:

**Macro innovations** tackle frontier scientific and technological challenges. These require exceptional talent, resources, motivation, and luck. Few people succeed because competition is intense and often zero-sum -- recognition goes primarily to the first discoverer.

**Micro innovations** address personal challenges like productivity, creativity, or relationship management. Examples include David Allen's Getting Things Done method, spaced repetition techniques, and deliberate practice approaches. The Pulitzer Prize-winning author John Cheever innovated a unique work routine: dressing formally, riding his apartment elevator downstairs, then writing in boxer shorts in the basement storage room.

## The Value of Micro Innovation

Unlike macro innovation, micro innovation offers accessible pathways for everyday people. There's no "problem of multiples" when solving individual challenges. Rewards arrive immediately and continuously, personalized to specific circumstances.

The author concludes that while macro innovations generate headlines and recognition, micro innovations provide immediate, self-empowering improvements available to everyone willing to experiment with their own lives.
