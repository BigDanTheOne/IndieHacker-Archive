Late last year, OpenAI founder Sam Altman and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian speculated that AI would soon create the first one-person unicorn company valued at over $1 billion. While that milestone hasn't arrived yet, several solo entrepreneurs are racing toward it by generating more than $1M in annual recurring revenue (ARR) without co-founders or employees.
