How Elston Baretto outsmarted the incumbents to build a $20k/month hosting business.

Hosting is one of the web's most competitive markets, but that hasn't slowed down Elston Baretto. Through a rugged work ethic and creative marketing strategies, Elston has scaled his hosting business, Tiny Host, to over $20,000 in MRR.

## Common Mistakes

New indie hackers spend excessive time developing while neglecting marketing and distribution. "Get the word out there as you're building it" rather than waiting for perfection.

## Finding Ideas

Two validated strategies include improving existing products for different audiences, and targeting keywords with proven search demand using analysis tools.

## Standing Out

Study competitor negative reviews to identify improvement opportunities in pricing, features, or user experience. Niching down -- targeting specific communities -- proves powerful early on.

## Success Indicators

Early user feedback and engagement matter more than immediate revenue. Baretto notes Tiny lacked significant MRR for a year, but consistent user praise sustained motivation.

## Marketing Strategies

SEO ranks as his primary approach, requiring patience and consistent content creation. YouTube videos and related side projects amplify reach. Reddit engagement works through transparency about intentions and offering value back to communities.

## Free Plan Rationale

Free tiers function as marketing tools when they create viral loops, generate manageable support volume, and include clear upgrade incentives.

## Pricing Approach

Launch below industry standards, then gradually increase prices as features develop. Higher pricing builds credibility; if customers aren't complaining about costs, pricing is likely too low.

## Coding Skills

Not essential for all businesses, especially with no-code tools and AI available. However, creating truly innovative products typically requires coding expertise.

## Future of Indie Hacking

AI will democratize product creation, shifting competitive advantages toward ideation, distribution, and salesmanship rather than coding ability alone.

## Final Advice

"Code less, market more, be a little lazy." Build community connections and find mentors slightly ahead in their journey.
