## 1. Launch a Viral Tweet — Even With Zero Followers

**The hack:** Craft a single, high-signal tweet announcing your product with a demo video/GIF. Tag nobody. Use no hashtags. Let the algorithm do the work.

**Evidence:**
- **Chatbase** — Yasser launched with 16 Twitter followers. One tweet with a demo GIF hit the algorithm. Result: **$5M ARR** within months. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/SRC9H50RFF9dV4n83ohl))*
- **Hatchet** — Tweeted a short demo video, got 500K+ impressions, converted to **$62K MRR in 3 months**. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/mUPVSYOlJAC2iogGK7d4))*
- **Multiple founders** report that a single well-crafted tweet with a compelling demo outperformed weeks of content marketing.

**Your playbook:**
1. Record a 30-second screen capture of the most impressive thing your product does
2. Write a tweet: "I built [thing] that [solves pain point]. Here's a demo:" + attach video
3. Post between 9–11am EST on Tuesday–Thursday
4. Reply to every comment within the first hour (engagement begets engagement)

## 2. Programmatic SEO — Auto-Generate 100+ Pages

**The hack:** Create template-driven landing pages targeting long-tail keywords at scale. One template, hundreds of pages, each targeting a specific search query.

**Evidence:**
- **Angel Match** — Auto-generated investor profile pages. Each page ranked for "[investor name] + angel investor." Result: **$42K MRR**, started from near-zero traffic. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/FGEm1BtZPZV9lqW4QptN))*
- **John Rush** — Built directories with programmatic SEO. Hit **$13K/mo** across multiple directory sites. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/2KasH9NLK3ehlTL9GeGO))*
- **Nomad List** (Pieter Levels) — City pages auto-generated from data. Each city = a landing page. Millions of visits. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/NToMGI3ZjwSBOfTywZnG))*

**Your playbook:**
1. Find a data source (APIs, public datasets, scraped info)
2. Build a template page: `/{keyword}-{modifier}`
3. Generate 100–1000 pages programmatically
4. Add unique value per page (not just templated text — add stats, comparisons, reviews)
5. Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
6. Wait 2–4 weeks for indexing, then iterate based on what ranks

## 3. Build in Public — But Use the 3-Phase Strategy

**The hack:** Don't just "build in public" randomly. Use a phased approach: (1) share everything early to build audience, (2) go ghost mode to ship, (3) return with selective transparency.

**Evidence:**
- **Marc Lou** — Shared revenue, code decisions, failures publicly. Built massive X following. Used audience to launch ShipFast → **$92K in 2 days** from a course launch. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/0bmnoYSUCBPO5xjJpk88))*
- **Tony Dinh** — Shared monthly revenue reports, product decisions, and failures. Grew to **$35K/mo + 1M followers**. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/HoAdarwA0jMPDAnY3sgu))*
- **Danny Postma** — Built in public with AI headshot generator → **$900K/mo**. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/UK9omiPofFtha5Kps2Fj))*

**Your playbook:**
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4):** Share daily — what you're building, why, revenue ($0 is fine), decisions, mistakes
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8):** Go quiet, ship hard. Only post milestones.
- **Phase 3 (Week 9+):** Share wins selectively. Revenue screenshots, user milestones, lessons learned.
- Platform priority: **X/Twitter first** (highest indie hacker density), then LinkedIn for B2B

## 4. Short-Form Video: 6 Reels/TikToks Per Day

**The hack:** Volume beats quality on short-form video. Post 4–6 times daily. Use AI tools to batch-create content. One viral hit pays for 100 duds.

**Evidence:**
- **Viktor Seraleev** — Posted 6 Reels/day for his app portfolio. Grew to **$60K/mo** across 30+ apps. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/myy3U7K9evxGOVOHti8s))*
- **Screaming Chicken Game** — Used TikTok exclusively. Hit **#1 in App Store downloads** with zero ad spend. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/I5QnJacIiUcdqrmnjCHm))*
- **Multiple founders** report TikTok/Reels as the single highest-ROI organic channel for consumer apps.

**Your playbook:**
1. Use AI to generate video scripts (ChatGPT → 10 scripts in 5 minutes)
2. Record in batches: 1 hour = 20+ short videos
3. Use CapCut or similar for quick editing with captions
4. Post 4–6x daily across TikTok, Reels, YouTube Shorts
5. Double down on formats that get >1000 views; kill formats that don't
6. Best content types: before/after demos, "I built X in Y hours", pain point → solution

## 5. Free Tool as an SEO Lead Magnet

**The hack:** Build a small, genuinely useful free tool. It ranks in Google, drives traffic, and funnels users to your paid product.

**Evidence:**
- **SignWell** — Built a free signature generator tool. It now drives **100K+ monthly visitors** and converts them into paying e-signature customers. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/waNA9cqqNRddE9RgPf9W))*
- **Tally** — Free form builder → **$37K/mo**. The free tier IS the marketing. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/x93KwOjEKWi9yugL3s02))*
- **Carrd** — Free website builder with generous free tier → **$2M ARR** with zero marketing spend. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/dbeoP4bDlEL3zzsivdgj))*

**Your playbook:**
1. Identify a painful micro-task in your niche (converter, calculator, generator, checker)
2. Build it as a standalone free tool (weekend project)
3. Optimize the page for "[task] + free tool" keywords
4. Add subtle upgrade prompts: "Want more? Try [paid product]"
5. The tool does your marketing 24/7 while you sleep

## 6. Webinar Funnel Instead of a Landing Page

**The hack:** Replace your static landing page with a live or recorded webinar. Webinars convert 137x better than cold landing pages for B2B products.

**Evidence:**
- **Multiple B2B founders** report webinar-to-trial conversion rates of 15–30% vs. landing page rates of 1–3%.
- **Groove** (Alex Turnbull) — Used educational webinars to grow to **$5M ARR** bootstrapped. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/efVlT8PlxYgugh2NepsV))*
- **PostHog** — Educational content and community events drove growth to a massive user base with minimal paid acquisition. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/LyKXL3L72fUI4HtsGRz5))*

**Your playbook:**
1. Record a 20-minute "how to solve [problem]" video (not a product demo)
2. Gate it behind an email capture
3. At minute 15, introduce your product as the solution
4. Follow up with a 3-email sequence: value → case study → offer
5. Automate the whole thing with an evergreen webinar tool

## 7. DM Someone With Distribution (Strategic Partnerships)

**The hack:** Find one person/company with your target audience and offer them something valuable in exchange for distribution. One partnership > 1000 cold emails.

**Evidence:**
- **Zlappo** — Partnered with a Twitter influencer for a single promo. Went from **$400 → $83K MRR**. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/9Al4ytu3R4Q0EHEawDqZ))*
- **ChartMogul** — Grew to **$10M ARR** primarily through strategic integrations (Stripe, Braintree, etc.). Each integration = access to the partner's entire user base. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/JLxCELkF6MvqUGuxgHuE))*
- **Multiple founders** report that a single strategic partnership outperformed months of content marketing.

**Your playbook:**
1. List 10 people/companies whose audience overlaps with yours
2. Offer genuine value first: free integration, co-created content, affiliate deal
3. DM them directly (Twitter DMs, LinkedIn, or cold email)
4. Propose a specific, low-effort collaboration (not "let's partner")
5. One "yes" from the right person can 10x your user base overnight

## 8. AppSumo / Lifetime Deals for Initial Blast

**The hack:** Launch a lifetime deal on AppSumo or similar platforms. You'll sacrifice long-term revenue for an immediate blast of users, feedback, and social proof.

**Evidence:**
- **Multiple founders** used AppSumo to get their first **10K+ customers** and hundreds of reviews, then pivoted to recurring subscriptions.
- **Lifetime deal launches** consistently generate **$50K–$200K** in a single campaign for early-stage products.
- Founders report that AppSumo reviews and user feedback in the first month are worth more than the revenue.

**Your playbook:**
1. Apply to AppSumo (or launch on DealMirror, SaaSMantra, PitchGround)
2. Price aggressively: $49–$79 lifetime for something worth $29/mo
3. Use the influx of users to get feedback, testimonials, and case studies
4. After the deal ends, switch to monthly/annual pricing for new customers
5. Warning: only do this if your marginal cost per user is near-zero

## 9. Ship in Hours, Not Months — AI-Powered MVP

**The hack:** Use AI coding tools (Cursor, Replit, Claude) to build and launch an MVP in hours or days, not weeks. Speed to market is the ultimate competitive advantage.

**Evidence:**
- **Pieter Levels** — Built a viral flight simulator with AI in **3 hours**. Generated immediate revenue. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/7CPfMr1yRLEwH6cC8xhE))*
- **Vibe coding movement** — Multiple founders shipping revenue-generating products in days using AI tools. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/2NUIOp80SUWuPmmfKoS9))*
- **Bolt/Lovable** — AI app builders helping non-technical founders hit **$100M ARR in 8 months**. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/ONMaxjB3rix2PnBCnrDr))*

**Your playbook:**
1. Describe your MVP to Claude/Cursor in plain English
2. Ship the ugliest working version in <24 hours
3. Put it in front of 10 potential users immediately
4. Iterate based on feedback, not assumptions
5. You're an engineer — your unfair advantage is speed. Use it.

## 10. Presell Before You Build — 50 Lifetime Deals = $20K+ Runway

**The hack:** Sell lifetime access to your product before writing a single line of code. If nobody buys, you saved months of wasted effort. If they buy, you have funded validation.

**Evidence:**
- **Multiple founders** presold lifetime deals via a landing page + Stripe checkout, raising **$10K–$50K** before building.
- **Josh Pigford** — Went from idea to **$24K exit in 30 days** by speed-validating with presales. *([Original post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/GN38dc6PAbsjjktdqjsu))*
- Founders report that presales convert at 2–5% from a warm audience (Twitter followers, newsletter subscribers).

**Your playbook:**
1. Create a landing page (Carrd, Framer — 1 hour max)
2. Write a clear value proposition and list planned features
3. Add a "Lifetime deal: $99 (normally $29/mo)" Stripe checkout
4. Share with your audience (even if tiny) and in relevant communities
5. If 0 sales after 100 visitors → pivot the idea
6. If 10+ sales → build with confidence and customer input

## Meta-Insight: Distribution Beats Product. Every. Single. Time.

Across all 552 posts, the single most consistent pattern is this: **founders who figured out distribution first succeeded faster than those who built great products and hoped people would find them.**

The best products in the archive aren't the most technically impressive — they're the ones attached to the best distribution channels (viral tweets, SEO, partnerships, communities, short-form video).

**Your priority order as an engineer with no audience:**
1. Pick a distribution channel (Hacks #1, #2, or #4)
2. Validate demand (Hack #10)
3. Build fast (Hack #9)
4. Amplify with leverage (Hacks #5, #7, #8)
5. Compound with community (Hack #3)
