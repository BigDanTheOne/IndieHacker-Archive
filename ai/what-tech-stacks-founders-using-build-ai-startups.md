The piece outlines nine essential components for AI startup development.

## The Stack

1. **Programming Language** - Python dominates due to its "wide range of libraries, is relatively easy to learn, and can be combined with other languages." Java, R, and C++ are alternatives.

2. **ML/Deep Learning Frameworks** - Tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch handle data processing. Deep learning frameworks suit complex tasks like image classification or speech recognition.

3. **Data Storage** - MySQL, Cassandra, and Apache Spark manage large datasets, with selection depending on data structure and volume.

4. **Cloud Computing** - AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform provide scalable, secure infrastructure that "only pay for what they need."

5. **Data Visualization** - Power BI, Seaborn, and Tableau help identify "trends and patterns, make better business decisions."

6. **Natural Language Processing** - SpaCy and Google Cloud Natural Language enable chatbots and virtual assistants to communicate authentically.

7. **Version Control** - Git tracks coding changes across team members working simultaneously.

8. **Deployment** - Docker and Seldon Core ensure platforms run "quickly, is safe and secure, and is easy to use."

9. **Collaboration Tools** - Slack, Trello, and Zoom facilitate remote team communication.
