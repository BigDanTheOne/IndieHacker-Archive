Aytekin Tank, founder of Jotform, outlines a comprehensive breakdown of AI agent opportunities across three categories.

## 1. AI Agents as Products

**Niche Market Solutions:**
Opportunities like hyper-local business agents for service providers, crowdfunding campaign management, grant-writing assistance for nonprofits, and personal cybersecurity monitoring. These target underexplored markets where automation remains scarce.

**Business Pain Point Solutions:**
Industry-specific customer support, freelancer automation tools, community moderation, eCommerce management, and content distribution represent B2B opportunities. Tank emphasizes "AI that solves business problems in new ways" drives significant value.

**Personal Productivity:**
Family scheduling automation, adaptive learning tutors, and life administration tools serve B2C markets.

## 2. Internal Process Optimization

Using AI agents internally for customer support automation, dynamic pricing, churn prediction, financial reporting, lead qualification, and employee onboarding -- operational improvements that reduce costs while improving efficiency.

## 3. Discovery Framework

Tank suggests founders: identify industries avoiding AI, target repetitive tasks, create personalized solutions, focus on fast-changing sectors, and monitor trend platforms like Trends.VC and Product Hunt.
