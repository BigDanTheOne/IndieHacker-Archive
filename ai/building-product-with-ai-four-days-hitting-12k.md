Sebastian Volkis, founder of TrendFeed, shares how he leveraged AI coding tools to rapidly develop a SaaS product. His background includes launching ChatIQ through Bubble, which reached 7.5k GBP monthly revenue but faced competitive challenges.

## Core Strategy

Volkis built TrendFeed using AI-generated code via Cursor, employing a Next.js and React stack. The product aggregates viral news and automates short-form video creation for content creators targeting Instagram and TikTok audiences.

## Launch Approach

Rather than traditional free signup funnels, Volkis employed a controlled webinar-based sales model. He notes: "controlled sales funnel: 400 clicks = 5,500 GBP in revenue" versus traditional SaaS conversion generating only 40 GBP/month from equivalent traffic.

## Key Insights

- Focus 70% of effort on marketing and distribution, not product perfection
- Leverage existing audience followings (50k Instagram, 30k TikTok, 4k YouTube)
- Use webinars to handle objections in real-time rather than passive landing pages
- Create content addressing customer pain points rather than product demos

## Results

TrendFeed generated 9,222 GBP ($12k) in its first four weeks, with his related course CodeSpring earning 45k GBP since January.
