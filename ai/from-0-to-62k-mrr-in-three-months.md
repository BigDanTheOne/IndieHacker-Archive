Cameron Trew, a former Senior Engineer at companies like Elastic Path and Vonage, left his high-paying corporate role to pursue entrepreneurship. He moved back with his parents and eventually partnered with Jake Ward, Lara Acosta, and Rob Hoffman to rebuild Kleo after its predecessor received a cease-and-desist from LinkedIn.

## The Core Achievement

Kleo 1.0 had 60,000 users before shutdown. The team rebuilt it as a paid SaaS product, launching v2.0 in four weeks and reaching $62k MRR within three months.

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Distribution Over Perfection:** The cofounders leveraged existing audiences (Jake: 180k LinkedIn followers; Lara: 300k+) rather than relying on paid advertising or Product Hunt launches.

2. **Speed-First Development:** Trew used Claude Code for AI-assisted development, allowing solo shipping with a modern tech stack including Next.js, TypeScript, Vercel, and Claude for AI capabilities.

3. **User-Centric Prioritization:** The team prioritized bug fixes first, followed by revenue-generating features and explicit user requests rather than internal assumptions.

4. **Beta-Driven Iteration:** They sold 500 lifetime discount spots twice ($59/month, then $79/month), gathering feedback between releases before public launch.

5. **Trust Through Transparency:** Behind-the-scenes updates, direct Slack community access, and rapid bug fixes (often within hours) built credibility.

## Business Model

Tiered subscriptions at $99/month standard pricing, with planned enterprise tiers for agencies.

## Forward Vision

Goals for 2026 include scaling Kleo to $300k MRR and companion product Mentions (currently $20k MRR) to $100k MRR, with acquisition target within 18 months.
