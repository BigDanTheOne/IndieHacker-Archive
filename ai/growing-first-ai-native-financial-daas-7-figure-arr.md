Braden Dennis transitioned from nuclear and hydropower engineering to fintech after becoming absorbed with markets and investing. He recognized a significant gap in financial data tools — expensive enterprise terminals on one end, clunky free platforms on the other — with nothing in between serving serious individual investors.

## The Problem and Solution

Dennis identified that "financial statements of every public company are freely available" yet aggregating them into a professional, accessible experience proved prohibitively difficult. He built Fiscal.ai as the first AI-native financial data company, addressing problems created by manual data aggregation's high costs and latency.

## Growth Metrics

Fiscal.ai has achieved:
- Mid-seven-figure ARR (over $400K monthly)
- Hundreds of thousands of users
- 50+ enterprise clients integrating their data into products
- Projected eight-figure ARR within six months

## Key Strategic Principles

**Product Development:** Dennis emphasizes that "building data (DaaS) products takes a lot longer than software (SaaS) products." Rather than waiting for perfection, the team launched with third-party integrations, using React/Next for frontend and Python/LLMs for backend infrastructure.

**Continuous Improvement:** Inspired by Toyota's Kaizen methodology, Dennis advocates perpetual incremental refinement rather than monolithic updates.

**Dual Growth Model:** Despite conventional wisdom suggesting founders choose between product-led growth or direct sales, Fiscal.ai successfully executes both simultaneously for B2C and B2B segments.

## Founder Advice

Dennis offers straightforward guidance: "Just start" with early customer validation rather than perfectionism. He emphasizes trusting intuition while managing incomplete information during early leadership phases, while cautioning against extreme emotional swings during startup journeys.
