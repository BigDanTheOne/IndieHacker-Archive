Tony Beltramelli built Uizard, an AI-powered product design platform that democratized UI/UX creation for non-designers. The company reached $3.5 million in annual recurring revenue before being acquired by Miro in June 2024.

## Origin Story

Beltramelli's journey began with a 2017 side project called pix2code that converted UI screenshots into HTML code. After sharing the research paper and open-source code on GitHub, the project gained significant traction, prompting him to establish Uizard as a commercial venture in 2018.

## Technical Approach

Rather than using WebGL or HTML canvas for the collaborative editor, Uizard built its infinite canvas directly with HTML DOM elements. This unconventional choice prioritized rapid iteration and leveraged browser-native UI component support.

## Growth Strategies

The platform leveraged multiple channels including viral demo videos, organic word-of-mouth (95% of new users), strategic SEO targeting AI-design keywords, and gamified waitlists that attracted over 100,000 monthly signups at peak periods.

## Business Model

Uizard operated primarily through product-led sales, with self-serve channels generating 98% of revenue and enterprise sales accounting for just 2%.
