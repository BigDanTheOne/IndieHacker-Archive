Pranay Agarwal transformed his side project into a profitable AI business. After identifying a gap in mockup generation tools, he and cofounder Mofid Ansari built Mockey as a nights-and-weekends project before Agarwal left his job in December 2023 to focus full-time.

## Business Model

The platform uses a freemium approach combining advertisements (generating ~$700/month) with subscription revenue. Free users can access three mockups daily with ads; paid subscribers get unlimited access.

## Growth Strategy

Agarwal emphasizes three primary tactics:
- Starting with a minimal viable product (t-shirt mockups only)
- Leveraging SEO through targeted content on mockup-related keywords
- Building community presence, particularly through a free Figma resource that drives users to the main platform

## Pivotal Moment

When the team introduced download limits, revenue increased approximately 300%, demonstrating how friction can convert free users to paying customers.

## Revenue Trajectory

The business generates 100,000 monthly visitors and produces $12,000 in monthly recurring revenue, with targets to reach $50,000/month by year-end.
