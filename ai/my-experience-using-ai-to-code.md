The author opens by explaining how lack of coding skills prevented them from building apps, despite having entrepreneurial ideas. A turning point came when Claude 3.5 Artifacts launched, enabling rapid prototyping from hand-drawn sketches.

## The Experience

The author describes uploading a sketch to Claude and receiving a functional demo within minutes. The AI accurately interpreted handwriting and added design elements like icons. However, initial excitement faded when features didn't work as intended, necessitating detailed instructions about functionality.

The piece compares AI development to skiing (easy entry, steep learning curve) versus no-code tools like snowboarding (difficult start, easier mastery).

## Tool Comparisons

- **ChatGPT** functions as an educational mentor, teaching step-by-step
- **Claude** offers rapid visualization through Artifacts, suitable for quick ideation
- **V0** (Vercel) excels at design using ShadCN components
- **Bolt** teaches development fundamentals effectively
- **Lovable** combines multiple tool strengths comprehensively
- **Replit** gamifies coding and offers a developer marketplace
- **Cursor** accelerates development for experienced programmers

## Key Findings

AI-generated prototypes typically reach 60-80% completion. The author acknowledges limitations for non-technical creators but sees potential for hiring freelancers or agencies to finish projects.
