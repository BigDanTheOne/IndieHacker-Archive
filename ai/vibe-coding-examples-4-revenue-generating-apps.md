This Indie Hackers piece showcases four successful applications built primarily through AI-assisted development, challenging skepticism about "vibe coding" — where developers rely on AI models to generate code through prompts.

## The Four Apps Featured

1. **ChatIQ** ($2K MRR) - AI customer support chatbot built by non-technical founder Sebastian Volkis, transitioning from no-code to full-stack development with approximately "80% of code generated using AI coding tools"

2. **Fly** ($12K MRR) - Browser-based multiplayer flight simulator created by Pieter Levels in just 3 hours, with roughly "90% AI-generated code with minimal manual adjustments"

3. **TrendFeed** ($10K MRR) - Content discovery platform also by Sebastian Volkis, reaching $12,000 revenue within four weeks using approximately "75% AI-generated code"

4. **Vibe Sail** ($8K MRR) - Multiplayer sailing simulator by Nicola Manzini featuring "85% of code AI-generated, with custom refinements for sailing mechanics"

The article details each product's revenue models, tech stacks, founder backgrounds, and development timelines, demonstrating viability of AI-assisted development for commercial applications.
