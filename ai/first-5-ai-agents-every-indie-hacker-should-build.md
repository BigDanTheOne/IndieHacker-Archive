Tank proposes that solo founders should prioritize building five AI-powered agents before hiring their first employee. Each agent automates specific business functions while preserving founder involvement in strategic areas.

## The Five Agents

1. **Email Triage Agent** -- Filters and routes messages using Gmail, Zapier, and GPT-4 to surface only urgent, user-related correspondence while auto-archiving low-priority items.

2. **Support Agent** -- Responds to common questions using FAQ documentation via tools like Jotform AI Agents or Chatbase, escalating complex inquiries to humans.

3. **Feedback Analyzer** -- Processes user feedback weekly, categorizing responses into bugs, feature requests, and UX confusion patterns for prioritization.

4. **Cold Outreach Agent** -- Generates personalized emails at scale using Google Sheets and GPT, maintaining human-sounding tone while reducing manual effort.

5. **Landing Page Insight Agent** -- Reviews weekly analytics and heatmap data, delivering 2-3 conversion recommendations based on user behavior patterns.

## What Remains Human

Product design decisions, early user interviews, initial hiring, and early MVP coding require founder involvement and cannot be delegated to AI effectively.
