Jozef Gherman transformed his financial situation through StealthGPT, an undetectable AI service. Starting with just $250 of his own capital and initial struggle, he built a subscription-based business generating $186,000 monthly in revenue within approximately one year.

## Revenue Breakdown

His product portfolio includes:
- StealthGPT: $186k/month
- AIBypass: $3.2k/month
- RapidResume: $570/month
- AIDetect: $400/month

He secured $400k in angel funding for 8% equity while maintaining operational control.

## Financial Discipline

Despite high revenue, Gherman maintains substantial monthly expenses ($175k) primarily driven by advertising and payroll. He retains conservative personal spending habits and emphasizes building emergency reserves before investing excess capital.

## Investment Philosophy

He concentrates investments in AI-focused companies (Microsoft, Nvidia) and dismisses cryptocurrency markets as predominantly fraudulent, stating "99% of the space is designed to scam people."

## Core Advice

Gherman emphasizes that founders require minimal capital to launch: "The opportunities are endless, and the cost is hilariously low."
