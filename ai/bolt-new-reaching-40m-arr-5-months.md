Bolt AI emerged from StackBlitz's leadership team, specifically CEO Eric Simons, who identified a critical gap in app development. The existing landscape featured "slow and complex" processes that deterred innovation through lengthy setup requirements and installation barriers.

The platform functions as a browser-based, AI-powered application builder. Users input natural language prompts describing desired applications, and the system generates complete functional apps within the browser environment — eliminating traditional installation steps.

## Growth Trajectory

Bolt.new's growth proved remarkable:
- $4 million ARR within 30 days of launch
- $20 million within three months
- $40 million within five months

The platform now serves five million users with over one million monthly additions. This positions Bolt as "the second-fastest such product in history behind only ChatGPT."

## Technology

The technology leverages WebContainers, enabling secure in-browser development environments that support real-time collaboration and instant deployment. The system generates complete full-stack applications — encompassing backend, frontend, and database layers — from simple prompts.
