Mattia Pomelli built Sleek, an AI-powered mobile app design tool, in just three weeks by repurposing code from previous design tool projects. The product reached $10,000 monthly recurring revenue within six weeks of launch — entirely through organic growth.

## Market Timing and Positioning

Pomelli identified an underserved niche: mobile app designers lacking design skills or resources. He positioned Sleek as a "vibe design" solution enabling rapid, beautiful app creation through conversational AI interaction.

## Organic Growth Approach

Rather than paid marketing, Pomelli leveraged X (Twitter) with a strategically crafted launch post designed to maximize engagement. He maintained momentum through consistent, value-first content sharing — designing apps for commenters and displaying AI-generated designs without directly promoting the product.

## Ideal Customer Profile Clarity

Unlike previous ventures serving diverse users, Sleek targeted a specific demographic: app founders and non-designer developers. This precision simplified feature prioritization, messaging, and distribution strategy.

## Limited Free Tier Strategy

Pomelli restricted free access to one generation, then required paid upgrades for edits — balancing AI costs against user acquisition. High-intent users recognized the value proposition and converted at strong rates.

## Technology Stack

Next.js, Supabase, Vercel, PostHog, Stripe, and Resend enabled rapid development and deployment.

## Future Direction

Pomelli plans testing additional channels including SEO and creator partnerships while maintaining product improvements based on customer feedback.
