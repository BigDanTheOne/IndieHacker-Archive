Aytekin Tank argues that indie hackers should streamline their AI tool usage rather than accumulating multiple subscriptions.

## Key Work Categories

- Writing tasks (emails, landing pages, content)
- Strategy work (planning, messaging, go-to-market)
- Research activities (competitor analysis, market sizing)
- Execution (follow-ups, data entry, outreach)

## Tool Recommendations by Function

**Writing:** Claude 3 Sonnet or GPT-4.5 -- they "understand nuance, tone, and emotion better than most others."

**Research:** Perplexity Pro or Gemini 1.5 for real-time analysis and pattern identification.

**Strategy and Planning:** GPT-4o or Claude 3 Opus for their logical reasoning capabilities.

**Execution:** ChatGPT custom GPTs, Zapier AI agents, and Jotform.

## Building a Lean Stack

Tank recommends selecting one primary model as a "daily driver," adding one niche tool based on your role, and avoiding tool proliferation unless each saves 5-10 hours weekly.

He proposes a one-hour challenge: test three tools on common tasks and retain only the highest performer.
