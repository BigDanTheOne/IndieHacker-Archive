Igor Ostrovsky left his position in 2021 to explore large language models and founded Augment Code, an AI coding platform targeting professional software engineers. The company is projected to reach $50M+ in revenue within the year, just six months after its public launch.

## Foundation and Vision

Ostrovsky grew up in Slovakia programming on vintage computers and later spent eight years building distributed-storage systems at Pure Storage. He noted that "GPT-3 had hinted that language models could reason about code," prompting his exploration into LLMs.

## Technical Architecture

The company built two foundational components:
- A real-time context engine handling massive codebases with millisecond latency
- Custom code-completion models trained before high-quality open-source alternatives existed

The stack leverages Go, Python, Rust, Kubernetes, gRPC, and supports VS Code and JetBrains IDEs.

## Strategic Philosophy

Ostrovsky emphasizes "building for next year" while shipping current solutions. He explains: "AI moves faster than anything we've seen before...the job is to ship for the current wave while secretly building foundations for the next one."

## Go-to-Market

The company uses a "try first" model featuring a 14-day unlimited free trial, self-serve IDE installation, and pricing based on successful user messages rather than token counting.
