AI coding tools are evolving rapidly, making it difficult for developers to identify which ones merit adoption and how they differentiate themselves. The author test-drove numerous AI code editors and related tools to evaluate their practical utility.

## The Nine Tools

**1. Codex CLI**
OpenAI's terminal-based coding agent supporting multimodal inputs including screenshots and diagrams. Powered by o3 and o4-mini models, it remains in early development but offers full open-source availability.

**2. Cursor**
An AI-enhanced VS Code fork with substantial community adoption. Features include inline AI editing, intelligent code completion, and an integrated agent that catalyzed the vibe coding movement. Pricing: $20/month unlimited or usage-based MAX mode.

**3. Cline**
A VS Code extension functioning as a sidebar agent with over 1.2 million installations. Sends all tokens to LLMs for superior output quality, though this increases costs. Includes a polished MCP marketplace.

**4. Roo Code**
A Cline fork featuring 380k+ installations with unique enhancements. Supports custom "modes" for repository-specific behavior optimization. The Boomerang Tasks feature decomposes complex assignments into manageable subtasks.

**5. Windsurf**
A standalone AI code editor built on VS Code with 2.5 million installations. Offers smart tab completion, inline editing, and integrated agents. Features one-click web deployment.

**6. Repo Prompt**
A minimalist IDE alternative emphasizing precise context selection from codebases. Designed for one-shot tasks and explicit control. Currently Mac-only.

**7. Claude Code**
Anthropic's terminal-based coding agent released early 2025, exclusively compatible with Claude models. Emphasizes simplicity: installation, execution, and terminal assistance without IDE learning curves.

**8. Aider**
Among the earliest terminal-first coding agents with 2 million+ installations. Distinguished by flexibility, supporting most major LLMs. Calibrated to simulate pair programming partnerships.

**9. Devin**
A web-based coding agent functioning as an autonomous virtual developer. Capable of independent task execution, pull request creation, and parallel operation. Previously $500/month, now available at $20.
