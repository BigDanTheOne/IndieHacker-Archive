Dan shares his approach to building an AI-powered SEO engine that achieved 200,000 monthly clicks from Google. The project, called TopTool, has since declined to approximately 50,000 clicks monthly.

## Core Strategy

The founder created an automated system that:
- Scraped Product Hunt launches using Apify
- Processed data through an LLM (ChatGPT) to generate structured content
- Translated pages into 10 languages
- Published SEO-optimized pages automatically

## Key Results

The project launched on Product Hunt, reaching "#4 Product of the Day," which helped establish initial domain authority. Within months, organic traffic skyrocketed after one keyword generated explosive impressions. Revenue eventually reached "$100-$500/month" from users paying to submit startups and obtain backlinks.

## Lessons Learned

Dan ultimately concluded that while the directory model was engaging to build, it proved difficult to scale profitably long-term. He transferred these SEO insights into subsequent projects, particularly BlogBowl, his SEO-optimized blogging platform.
