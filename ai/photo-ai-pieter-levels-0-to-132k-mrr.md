This comprehensive case study examines Pieter Levels' Photo AI product, which achieved $132K monthly recurring revenue within 18 months of launch in February 2023.

## Revenue Trajectory

The product grew from approximately $5.4K MRR in its first week to $132-138K MRR by November 2025, representing an estimated $1.6-1.65M annual run rate.

## Product Architecture

Levels built Photo AI using a notably simple tech stack: vanilla PHP (14,000 lines), SQLite database, vanilla JavaScript, and jQuery — deliberately avoiding modern frameworks. This approach prioritized shipping speed over technological trends. Infrastructure consisted of a single DigitalOcean VPS, with GPU compute costs handled through the Replicate API.

## Business Model

The service operates on a tiered subscription model ranging from $19 to $199 monthly, with the Premium tier at $99 identified as most popular. The business maintains an 87% profit margin, with primary expenses limited to GPU compute costs (~$13K monthly).

## Distribution Success

The most significant growth driver was Pieter's existing audience of 600K+ Twitter followers, accumulated through a decade of building products publicly. Secondary channels included organic search, press coverage, and podcast appearances — particularly a three-hour Lex Fridman interview that generated substantial traffic spikes.

## Founding Philosophy

Levels emphasized shipping incomplete products quickly, charging customers from day one (avoiding free tiers), and iterating based on actual user feedback rather than theoretical requirements.
