The piece profiles Joe, a Toronto university student who leveraged AI technology to build a lucrative e-book publishing business. Starting in 2020 after high school, Joe experimented with OpenAI's GPT-3 and eventually created an enterprise generating AI-written books.

## Business Model

Joe's business model involved using AI to draft book outlines and develop chapters, then refining content based on competitor analysis. His breakthrough came through targeted Pinterest advertising aimed at middle-aged women, supported by professional landing pages. By August 2022, he had published 40 AI-generated books.

## Results

His brand valuation reached $930,000 with profits around $390,000.

## Key Advice

Joe emphasizes that success required more than automation -- his competitive advantage stemmed from strategic marketing and building customer loyalty.

"Prioritize learning over earning. By focusing on acquiring skills rather than how much I'm earning, I found that it was nearly impossible for me to fail with my book brand."
