Sam Kamrani describes his journey as a technical founder exploring various business models. After experiencing frustration with freelancing and service-based work due to poor income-to-effort ratios, he became interested in SaaS ventures. However, he identifies two major obstacles: "It requires a lot of time and resources to build something meaningful" and marketing challenges.

## The Solution

To address these barriers, Kamrani and his collaborators launched PromptIntellect, a marketplace for AI-powered microservices. The platform aims to democratize SaaS creation by offering:

- Low entry barriers requiring only Lambda functions in supported languages
- Direct payment per service execution
- Flexibility to experiment with multiple services across categories
- Scalability without substantial upfront investment

## Implementation

The implementation process is straightforward: developers write Lambda functions following documented conventions, with an open-source repository providing language-specific examples.
