Bhanu Teja Pachipulusu announced the rapid growth of SiteGPT, an AI chatbot platform enabling users to create conversational agents trained on website content. The product achieved $10,000 monthly recurring revenue within its first month.

## Launch Strategy

The launch strategy leveraged social media distribution, beginning with a viral tweet that subsequently drove the product to the front page of Hacker News and #1 status on Product Hunt. Pachipulusu notes: "Twitter, HN and PH are the main ones. Once it gets on these platforms, there will be ripple effects."

## Construction Timeline

The founder built and launched within 2-3 weeks despite shipping with numerous bugs. He emphasizes speed over perfection: "Just launch it. For SiteGPT, one day, I decided to work on it...within 2-3 weeks, I have a product ready."

## Key Metrics

- Approximately 200 customers
- Churn rates fluctuating between 10-20%
- Combined operational costs for SiteGPT and his other SaaS product (Feather) totaled $3,000-$5,000 monthly

## Distribution

The founder credits Twitter as primary distribution channel, followed by organic Google searches for "SiteGPT." He deliberately avoided competitor analysis, focusing instead on customer feedback for product development direction.
