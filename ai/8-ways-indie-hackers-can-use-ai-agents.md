The piece outlines how AI agents differ from standard AI tools by taking actionable steps rather than simply providing information.

## The Eight Applications

1. **Customer Support** - Agents process refunds, reset passwords, and escalate issues intelligently rather than just answering FAQs.

2. **Lead Qualification** - They engage prospects, ask qualifying questions, and book demos automatically without manual intervention.

3. **User Onboarding** - Agents guide new users based on behavior and send personalized follow-ups to inactive users.

4. **Administrative Tasks** - They schedule meetings, prioritize emails, and generate reports without human input.

5. **Market Research** - Agents continuously monitor competitors and extract actionable insights from data sources.

6. **Content Distribution** - They generate drafts, repurpose content across channels, and auto-respond to comments.

7. **Sales Outreach** - Agents personalize emails, track responses, and follow up based on engagement signals.

8. **Workflow Automation** - They identify repetitive tasks and automate end-to-end processes across integrated tools.

Each section includes setup instructions and real-world examples from Jotform's implementation, emphasizing that "AI agents can actually take action for you."
