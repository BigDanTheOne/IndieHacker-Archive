Alex Rainey transformed a failed VC-backed venture into a thriving bootstrapped SaaS business generating $40,000 monthly recurring revenue. His company, My AskAI, enables organizations to deploy AI-powered customer support agents integrated with platforms like Intercom and Zendesk.

## Business Metrics

- **Current MRR:** $40,000
- **Annual Revenue:** ~$500,000
- **Monthly Support Chats:** 75,000+
- **Team Size:** 2 people
- **Gross Margin:** 82%
- **Churn Reduction:** Decreased from 9% to 3%

## Development Timeline

The MVP launched in three weeks using Bubble and OpenAI with minimal investment. The company hit $10k MRR in month four, experienced a stall, pivoted toward customer support specialization, then accelerated to $40k MRR six months later.

## Critical Lessons

Rainey emphasized that "shiny-object syndrome" wasted considerable time in year one. He recommends niching down earlier, recognizing that "growth is messy" without perfect attribution, and leveraging SEO with clear, specific messaging rather than pursuing paid acquisition channels.

His advice prioritizes selling before building, treating constraints as focusing mechanisms, and maintaining discipline around retained, paying customers rather than vanity metrics.
