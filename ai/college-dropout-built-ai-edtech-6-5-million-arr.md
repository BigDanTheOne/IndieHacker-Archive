David Park, age 27, transformed his AI writing tool into a $30 million startup called Jenni AI. His entrepreneurial journey involved four failed ventures before finding success in the AI education technology space.

## Key Milestones

- Started with a high school clothing brand that failed
- Dropped out of college to pursue tech startups
- Attempted dating apps and social media tools — all unsuccessful
- Founded Jenni AI with a co-founder interested in natural language processing
- Achieved $6.5 million ARR in under two years

## Critical Turning Point

The breakthrough came through a viral X thread by Superhuman founder Zain Kahn, which drove 10 new users per second to the platform. This catalyzed exponential growth from $2,000 to $533,000 in monthly revenue.

## Business Model

Jenni uses freemium pricing with a 200-word daily free tier and $30/month paid plans featuring a substantial 60% annual discount. Their influencer program pays $15 per referral plus $5 monthly for retained subscribers.

## Marketing Strategy

With only three team members, they leveraged organic short-form content, influencer partnerships, SEO, and targeted ads. Their "POV: You have an essay due" content series generated over 300 million views and exceeded $500,000 in revenue.

## Personal Challenge

Park received a cancer diagnosis during the company's growth phase but became cancer-free following surgery months later.
