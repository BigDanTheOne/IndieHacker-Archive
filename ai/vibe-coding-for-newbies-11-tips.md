This guide covers eleven practical strategies for AI-assisted development, a practice coined by Andrej Karpathy roughly a month prior to publication.

## The 11 Tips

1. **Smart Model Selection** - Leverage advanced models (Grok 3, GPT-4.5, o1 Pro) for planning and creating product requirements documents before coding begins.

2. **Iterative Restarting** - Accept that initial attempts won't be perfect; build exploratively, learn the specification through implementation, then rebuild with refined understanding.

3. **Modular File Organization** - Request separate, well-organized files rather than monolithic code to prevent context overwhelm.

4. **Context Management** - Recognize that AI assistants only understand information within their current context; skillfully manage what's included with each request.

5. **Expect Volume** - Anticipate needing hundreds of prompts to create production-ready applications.

6. **Manual Intervention** - Be prepared to write code yourself when AI systems get stuck, particularly in complex codebases.

7. **Smart Code Review** - Use more powerful models for reviewing and debugging rather than manually reviewing everything.

8. **CRUD Over Games** - Expect better results building database applications than graphical projects.

9. **Three.js for 3D** - Use Three.js specifically when developing three-dimensional games.

10. **Raw Code for 2D** - Avoid game engines for two-dimensional projects; request custom implementations instead.

11. **Public Sharing** - Document your building process on social media to gain feedback and discover solutions from the community.
