## Products

- Clockify (time tracking) - launched 2017
- Pumble (team communication) - launched 2020
- Plaky (project management) - launched 2022

## Key Metrics

- 96%+ gross margins
- Profitable
- Bootstrapped with no external funding

## Core Strategy

Milanovic built a consulting business to finance product development over 10 years. He solved internal pain points first -- when his time-tracking software's price increased, his team built Clockify in three months with eight people.

"We offered a product that people needed at a price that no one else wanted to match," reflecting his undercut-the-competition approach while providing transparent pricing.

## Growth Drivers

**Organic Expansion:** Clockify reached 17,000 users in five days. The founder leveraged his network, then focused on SEO and content marketing before formal marketing efforts began in 2021.

**Product Philosophy:** Each tool solved real company needs -- genuine "eating your own dogfood" rather than hypothetical problem-solving.

**Timing Factor:** Pandemic lockdowns increased demand for productivity solutions, though Milanovic acknowledges this as fortunate timing.

## Key Lessons

- Choose distribution methods aligned with your personality
- Build slowly without rushing, even with available capital
- Transparency builds trust better than aggressive sales tactics
- Sustainable growth requires matching product-market fit with team talent availability
