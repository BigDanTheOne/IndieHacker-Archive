## The Story

Viktor built his indie app business from scratch three times. His first major success came from solving a personal need -- his wife couldn't find an app to create before-and-after slider effects for manicure photos. He built the solution, grew it to $34,000 monthly revenue, and sold it for $410,000.

However, 2022 brought a "black swan event." When Viktor relocated from Russia to Chile, his revenue dropped from 75% Russian sources to nearly zero. Simultaneously, Apple terminated his developer account after eight months of investigation. A bank closure due to sanctions froze his remaining funds.

Facing complete devastation, Viktor rebuilt by adopting a portfolio approach: build 10 high-quality, genuinely useful apps by year-end. He now maintains 30+ apps using subscription models.

## Key Lessons

1. **Portfolio over single bet:** Multiple smaller apps reduce platform risk
2. **Platform independence matters:** Building across iOS, Android, and web prevents total collapse
3. **Small bets teach faster:** The "10 apps challenge" revealed which niches work
4. **Transparency builds resilience:** Sharing journey publicly attracted community support
5. **Stability beats excitement:** Long-term predictability became more valuable

## Core Advice

- "Never give up. Stay strong, even when things are hard"
- "Don't be afraid to be open... Long-term trust matters more than short-term optics"
- Subscriptions (weekly/yearly plans) with seasonal discounts (30-40% revenue boost) beat advertising
- Native development (Swift) for video-heavy apps; cross-platform tools for non-video products
