## Overview

Swifteq is a portfolio of focused SaaS applications built on the Zendesk marketplace. Suite includes ticket/help center translation, agent copilot, automation tools, and efficiency-focused applications.

## The Story

Sorin started as a solo founder after previous entrepreneurial attempts. He invested significant time researching community forums like Support Driven and Zendesk's community, identifying recurring pain points.

First app: "Merge Duplicated Tickets" -- solved the repetitive task of manually consolidating duplicate tickets.

## Strategy

Rather than betting on one product, Sorin deliberately built a portfolio approach. Each app solves a specific problem Zendesk doesn't address adequately. This diversification reduces platform risk while creating natural upsell opportunities.

## Key Lessons

1. **Distribution Over Building:** "Building is the easy part." Developers instinctively code for months before considering customers.
2. **Platform Risk Management:** When Zendesk released overlapping features, lost ~$2,000 MRR. Reinforced portfolio diversification importance.
3. **Portfolio Approach Reduces Risk:** Revenue losses from one product's decline are offset by others.
4. **Community Immersion:** Success stemmed from genuine participation in support communities.
5. **Energy Protection:** Burnout is the primary failure mode for bootstrapped founders.

## Five Pieces of Advice

1. Focus on distribution from day one
2. Hire a developer earlier than feels comfortable
3. Price high -- underpricing attracts uncommitted customers
4. Don't isolate yourself -- maintain connections with experienced founders
5. Protect your energy -- sustainability beats hero efforts
