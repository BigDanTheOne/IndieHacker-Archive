## Background

Vedran's family lost their savings in a post-war Yugoslavia bank crash. A decade later, they recovered just 600 EUR -- enough to buy his first computer. He built a digital studio, then launched Autoklose in 2018, which was acquired in 2020.

## The Story

LeadDelta launched in 2022 from an idea carried since 2017. Rather than raise significant capital, Vedran acquired a tiny product for thousands, spent one month refactoring, and shipped. Within weeks, 500+ people subscribed. Positioning: "While everyone else automated and scraped, we positioned ourselves as the manager of their connections."

## Key Lessons

1. **Start Lean, Ship Fast:** "Unless I'm splitting the atom, there's no reason to raise big money or build for months."
2. **De-Risk Through Distribution:** Leverage your own network first.
3. **Weekly Shipping Matters:** Consistent product velocity signals investment to users.
4. **B2C2B Model Works:** Win individual power users; teams naturally follow.
5. **Pricing Experimentation:** "Change pricing every three to six months." Recently 3x-ed pricing.
6. **Focus on Core Metrics:** "Am I building?" and "Am I selling?"
