## Background

Jesse Pujji built Ampush, a digital marketing agency managing over $1 billion in ad spend for clients like Uber, Birchbox, and Hulu. He exited the company for a mid-eight-figure acquisition and now operates Gateway X, a venture studio.

## Current Portfolio

- **Growth Assistant**: Offshore growth marketer integration service
- **Aux Insights**: Digital marketing due diligence for private equity
- **Unbloat**: Direct-to-consumer gut health supplement brand

## Origin Story

Pujji left his Goldman Sachs position at 25, driven by curiosity about Facebook's emerging advertising platform. Working with college roommates, he launched Ampush with just $100,000 in pooled savings plus credit cards.

## Key Growth Strategies

**Narrow Focus:** "Amazon started with books, Facebook started with colleges" -- successful businesses own niches before expanding.

**Testing Approach:** Rather than perfecting everything upfront, Pujji embraced "guess and test," starting with hypotheses about ideal customers and iterating based on feedback.

**Aligned Incentives:** Ampush's performance-based model tied agency revenue to client success, creating mutual benefit and trust.

## Critical Lessons

**Hiring:** Early mistakes prioritizing technical skills over cultural fit created friction. Alignment with values proved equally important as expertise.

**Delegation:** Pujji struggled with letting go, causing burnout and bottlenecks until empowering the team to handle high-time, low-risk tasks.

**Margin Management:** In service businesses, monitoring costs and profitability per account was essential for sustainable scaling.

## Current Philosophy

Pujji limits himself to launching one new venture annually to avoid overextension. He maintains the Bootstrapped Giants newsletter (25,000+ subscribers) covering sales, finance, and hiring.
