## The Story

Oliver began coding at age 12, spent years freelancing, then realized the power of passive income after making $25 without trading time. He published free Rails tutorials that gained traction on StackOverflow, created paid courses ($39 each) but struggled -- selling only 2 copies monthly initially.

The breakthrough came when someone submitted GoRails to Hacker News, landing at #2 and generating 600 new subscribers overnight.

## Key Lessons

1. **Marketing before perfection:** "I had to spend a lot more time on marketing, rather than the product"
2. **Community as distribution:** Speaking at conferences, maintaining a 7,000-member Discord, contributing open-source code
3. **Validate willingness to pay:** Reducing free trial from generous to 5 days and requiring upfront credit cards filtered for serious customers
4. **Build ecosystems, not islands:** Complementary products serving identical customers enabled upselling
5. **Teaching problem-solving over syntax:** As AI commoditizes code generation, teaching architectural thinking provides lasting value

## Advice

"Go talk to people and see what you can help with... you find a problem that multiple people have and build a product out of it."
