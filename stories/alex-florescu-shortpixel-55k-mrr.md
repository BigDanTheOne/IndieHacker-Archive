## The Origin

Alex initially built a sophisticated image optimization API as a side project. Though technically impressive, it was "largely useless" because customers couldn't access it. The pivotal moment: transforming the API into a simple WordPress plugin.

## Key Lessons

**The Pivot Strategy:** Creating the WordPress plugin solved the accessibility problem and unlocked sustainable growth.

**Pricing Evolution:** "Flat-fee, unlimited plans weren't just easier -- they were more profitable" for both business and customers.

**Infrastructure at Scale:** Processing 20 million images daily required evolving from basic servers to 40+ specialized machines, maintaining 99.9% uptime.

## Growth Strategies

1. Strategic Partnerships with related WordPress plugin developers
2. Competitive Monitoring using tools like Talkwalker
3. Affiliate Program as long-term sustainable growth engine
4. Deal Site Promotions (particularly AppSumo) -- generating 10,000+ customers
5. Organic Discovery through WordPress.org plugin marketplace
6. Abandoned Paid Advertising when ROI didn't justify costs

## Founder's Advice

- "Don't be afraid of doing things that don't scale" during early phases
- "Progress comes from showing up every day, even if just an hour"
- Hire earlier than comfortable
- Focus over fragmentation -- side projects diluted innovation
- Strategic pricing attracts aligned customers
