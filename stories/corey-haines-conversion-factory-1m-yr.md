## The Story

Corey Haines explicitly avoided building a marketing agency despite his expertise. After being laid off with minimal savings, he reluctantly embraced the idea. He launched Conversion Factory with two cofounders, hitting $36K MRR within two months.

The key differentiator: productization. Rather than traditional hourly or project-based work, Haines designed a subscription model with fixed pricing ($6K-$20K/month), asynchronous workflows, and standardized processes.

## Core Strategy

**Pricing Model:**
- Subscription-based retainers, not hourly billing
- Fixed plans starting at $6,000/month
- $1,000 audit as customer acquisition tool
- Add-on services for additional revenue

**Operational Excellence:**
- Strict asynchronous-only communication (no meetings/Slack with clients)
- Kanban-style task management in Notion
- Limited concurrent projects per client to maintain quality
- Atomized workflows: copywriting -> design -> development

## Tech Stack

Webflow, Figma, Stripe, Notion, Zapier, ChatGPT, Loom.

## Key Lessons

1. Constraints fuel innovation -- being reluctant forced differentiation
2. Audience + distribution matter -- leveraged 20K X followers, 30K newsletter subscribers
3. Productization scales -- fixed services remove complexity
4. Hire early -- recognized as essential to scaling
5. The stair-step method works -- use agency revenue to fund software projects

## Advice

"I think it's very underrated to go all in on a productized service or agency. Then you can take all the earnings from that business into whatever you want to build next."
