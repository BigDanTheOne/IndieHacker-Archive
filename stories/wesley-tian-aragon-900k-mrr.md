## Business Overview

Tian created Aragon to eliminate the friction of professional headshots. Traditional photoshoots cost ~$250 and require scheduling, travel, and makeup. His platform generates hyperrealistic photos in minutes at $35-$75 per package. The company serves 1.3+ million users and has generated over 30 million photos.

## Origin Story

Tian discovered Stable Diffusion and Dreambooth research through X in 2022 -- technologies he recognized as inflection points. With $15-20K in savings, he rapidly tested 12 different app concepts on waitlists. Users gravitated toward appearance-changing features, leading him to focus on professional headshots.

The prototype launched in a single day using Gradio.

## Tech Stack

React, NextJS, TypeScript, AWS -- largely unchanged since launch.

## Key Growth Strategies

**Distribution channels that worked:**
- Guerrilla marketing (Reddit posts claiming dating/job success)
- Building audience on X and LinkedIn
- Affiliate program through Rewardful, improving Google rankings
- Conversion rate optimization and A/B testing

**Approaches that failed:**
- Cold email outreach
- Meta (Facebook) advertising
- PR efforts

## Critical Lessons

"Most founders don't launch early enough. Our first landing page was terrible, but timing mattered."

Additional insights:
- Move fast when adopting new technologies -- test, adopt, and ship quickly
- Keep expenses low while maintaining high margins
- Avoid vanity metrics; focus on genuine business health
- Build networks actively, especially on X and LinkedIn

## Personal Philosophy

Tian prioritizes discipline, routine, and competitive drive. He struggled with work-life balance, experiencing two burnouts. He now advocates for exercise (5+ days weekly), consistent sleep schedules, and mandatory rest periods.
