## Background

Dominic is a Dutch engineer who studied physics in Germany and Brazil, worked as a space engineer at Airbus, and later as a data analyst in fintech. He previously founded Traverse, a language-learning SaaS.

## The Story

In early 2023, Dominic caught "AI FOMO" after experimenting with ChatGPT. The breakthrough came when scratching his own itch: "I decided to scratch my own itch with SEO for my other project, Traverse." This pivot led to automated SEO content creation.

The crucial strategic shift: pivoting to focus exclusively on agencies. An accidental discovery revealed strong demand when they priced a multi-site plan higher to make base plans appear cheaper.

## Growth Metrics

- 6 months post-pivot: $200K ARR
- 15 months: $1M ARR
- 24 months: $2M ARR

## Key Strategies

### 1. Validation Through Paid Ads
Meta Ads provided immediate market feedback. ~$1K to acquire first customer at $499/month -- 2-month payback period. "If you don't want to fool yourself, use paid ads to validate your idea."

### 2. Three-Tier Funnel
- Top: Awareness (pain-point focused)
- Middle: Solution consideration (competitive positioning)
- Bottom: Conversion (social proof, urgency, free trials)

### 3. Value Ladder Strategy
"Pitch Mode" -- an affordable entry-level tool addressing customer pain points. Lower barrier converted users who later upgraded.

### 4. Strategic Positioning
Rather than "AI writer" or general SEO tool, became "the automated SEO delivery platform for agencies."

## Three Core Pieces of Advice

1. "Use paid ads to validate ideas" -- they force real decisions with real money
2. "You're never late to the party" -- the Twitter/X bubble represents only 1% of technology adopters
3. "Team up" -- cofounders help identify blind spots

## Tech Stack
