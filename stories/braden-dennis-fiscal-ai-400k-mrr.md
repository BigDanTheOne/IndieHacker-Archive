## The Origin Story

Dennis transitioned from nuclear and hydropower engineering to fintech after becoming obsessed with markets and investing. He identified a critical gap: "expensive and exclusive financial data terminals on one end of the spectrum. At the other, free, clunky, ad-filled, and unserious platforms."

Financial statements are publicly available, yet aggregating and delivering them cleanly proved prohibitively difficult. Dennis built the first AI-native financial data company to solve this problem.

## Key Insights

**On Data vs. Software:** Building data products takes considerably longer than software products. Dennis acknowledges doing both simultaneously required patience and continuous iteration.

**The Kaizen Approach:** Inspired by Toyota's continuous improvement framework: "It's never perfect. You chase continuous improvement forever."

**Finding the Market Gap:** The "missing middle" positioning -- between enterprise-grade tools and free platforms -- proved powerful. This clarity prevented feature creep.

**Hybrid Growth Model:** Despite conventional wisdom that companies cannot simultaneously pursue product-led growth and direct sales, Dennis proves it works when serving both B2C and B2B with identical products, just different sales motions.

## Growth Strategy

Product-led growth without paid advertising while expanding into enterprise direct sales. Over 50 enterprises now use Fiscal.ai's data in their products, with hundreds of thousands of trusted users.

## Advice for Founders

"Just start. And get a few customers who want you to help them solve their problems." Trust intuition during early-stage decision-making with incomplete information, while maintaining emotional equilibrium through inevitable ups and downs.
