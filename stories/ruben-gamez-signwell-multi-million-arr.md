## Origin Story

Gamez discovered the opportunity through his first SaaS product, Bidsketch. Thousands of customers requested better e-signature solutions, revealing a market gap. "Enterprise-grade features and compliance at an affordable price, with intuitive UX."

## Key Metrics

- Tens of thousands of paying customers
- Over 10 million signed documents

## Key Lessons

### 1. Launch with Brutal Simplicity
The MVP launched without critical features -- no audit trails, templates, API, or compliance certifications. Gamez manually generated audit reports initially. This "wildly basic" approach validated demand before overengineering.

### 2. Indirect Distribution Outperforms Direct Competition
Instead of competing head-on for e-signature searches, SignWell targeted adjacent problems. Creating free contract templates attracted 100K+ monthly visitors -- users who would naturally need signing solutions next.

### 3. Learn Relentlessly from Market Insiders
Gamez ran Twitter ads offering Amazon gift cards for 10-minute calls with competitors' customers. He also consulted weekly with e-signature sales reps.

### 4. Pricing Strategy Matters in Crowded Markets
Maintained unlimited documents and 5x cheaper per-document fees than competitors, combined with enterprise-grade security.

### 5. Do Uncomfortable Things
"Become good at doing uncomfortable things... the most growth comes by doing things that initially feel unnatural."

## Distribution Approach

- Twitter ads targeting competitor audiences
- Free contract templates (SEO-driven)
- "Dream 100" partner outreach strategy
- Sponsorships, integrations, and API partnerships for enterprise adoption
