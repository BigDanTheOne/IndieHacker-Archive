## The Journey

After a layoff, Hallam spent 2.5 years building five products that generated zero revenue. During this period, he consistently posted about his work on X, which eventually led to one viral post reaching 200,000 views. Someone suggested he start a dev agency, and he landed his first $3,000 client that same day.

He partnered with Tibo Louis-Lucas, who owned a Chrome extension called SuperX. Together, they rebuilt it as a full web application, launching in July 2025 with $1K MRR on day one.

## Key Lessons

**Distribution Over Product:** "If I had to start over, I'd focus on distribution from day one. My first five products failed because nobody knew they existed."

**Consistency Compounds:** Posted daily content until reaching $10K MRR, growing from 900 to 40,000 followers.

**Validate Before Building:** "Ask people to pay before you build the thing."

**Strategic Content Loop:**
1. Start entertaining/vulnerable for attention
2. Follow with education or product demo
3. Share results and metrics
4. Repeat

**Video Performance:** Switching from text to video delivered 10x reach increase on X.
