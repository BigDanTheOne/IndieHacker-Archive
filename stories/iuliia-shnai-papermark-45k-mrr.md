## The Story

Iuliia transitioned from her PhD to founding a startup. In 2019, she launched an EdTech product but spent excessive time fundraising and relying on unsustainable sales channels like AppSumo. After raising a pre-seed round and building a team of ten, the venture failed in late 2022.

She committed to daily social media posting and discovered indie hacking. With no deep technical background, she built 10 products throughout 2023. One -- Postli (LinkedIn post generator) -- went viral but couldn't achieve PMF.

Her partner Marc launched Papermark, an open-source Docsend alternative. Both projects hit $500 MRR concurrently, but Postli stalled while Papermark showed promise. In January 2024, they committed full-time to Papermark.

## Growth: $1K to $45K MRR in 12 Months

**Blog as primary growth driver:** Bottom-of-funnel SEO content -- comparison pages and alternative content targeting competitors' customers. "People love a good open-source alternative."

## Core Lessons

1. Focus on a single distribution channel and develop it deeply
2. Launch quickly with minimal viability -- "Just build and launch as soon as you can"
3. Leverage open-source positioning for organic discovery
4. Build what energizes you -- abandoned cold LinkedIn sales for content work
5. Complementary cofounder roles matter -- separating product from growth strategy

## Pricing Evolution
