## Background

George grew up in the Bay Area with software engineer parents. He left college during his sophomore year to co-found Uversity, a social networking platform for universities, where he served as CTO. The company raised venture capital and was eventually acquired.

## The Problem Discovery

While running mobile gaming studio Hiptic Games with co-founder Long, George and his partner faced a critical challenge: retaining players after they downloaded apps. Push notifications existed but the infrastructure was unreliable. They built internal tools for messaging across push, email, and SMS just to keep their games viable.

"This wasn't just a niche problem for us. This was a fundamental need for every app developer," George realized, prompting the pivot to OneSignal.

## Unconventional Funding

Rather than immediate venture capital, George sustained himself through bug bounties on platforms like Facebook, Dropbox, and Coinbase -- at one point ranking as Facebook's #2 highest-paid researcher. This work sharpened his ability to identify priorities in complex systems.

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Cross-platform SDKs:** Supporting Unity, React Native, and Flutter (not just native)
- **Localization:** Built-in from launch
- **Freemium model:** Unlimited push notifications, 10,000 free emails monthly, no credit card required

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Ruby on Rails
- **Backend:** Rust for core services (prioritizing reliability at scale)
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL and ScyllaDB

## Key Lessons

**Build from inside-out:** "When you've sat in that exact seat, you know what actually matters and you're more motivated to get it right."

**Timing matters:** The economics only worked because NVMe storage became affordable. "Products like OneSignal didn't really exist before. Not because people didn't want them, but because the economics didn't work."

**Freemium democratizes:** Most competitors required sales calls before trials. OneSignal's approach created word-of-mouth momentum and revealed untapped market segments.

## Advice for Founders

1. Start with personal pain -- look for repetitive problems you experience
2. Commit to the attempt -- set real milestones and ship
3. Learn from outcomes -- progress reveals important insights
4. Build technical depth -- learning to code provides advantages for most founders

## Metrics

- 2+ million developers and marketers using the platform
- Serves everyone from indie developers to Fortune 500 companies and government agencies
