## The Origin Story

Rubel started Vecteezy while earning $40,000 annually as a designer at Camping World. Needing extra income after marriage, he combined his design skills with digital marketing knowledge, initially offering free graphics supported by Google Ads revenue. He unknowingly pioneered the freemium model in stock photography.

## Building Phase

The first version was designed in Photoshop with development outsourced to a freelance programmer. For seven years, Vecteezy remained a "lifestyle business" without serious scaling efforts. The turning point arrived when hiring Adam Gamble as CTO transformed operations and accelerated growth.

## Key Turning Points

**The Competitor's Call:** An established stock photo agency threatened legal action, claiming Rubel stole their graphics. Unable to substantiate claims, they dropped it. Rubel recognized this as validation: "I was shaking things up, and the old guard didn't like it."

**Accidental Virality:** Submitting to Digg.com on Friday night sparked weekend viral growth. His developer worked continuously maintaining servers through the traffic surge, establishing strong search rankings lasting to today (20M monthly visitors).

## Revenue Evolution

- **Initial model:** 100% advertising revenue
- **Current breakdown:** Subscriptions dominate; advertising now <30%
- **Marketplace structure:** Contributors receive 50% revenue share based on usage (similar to Spotify's musician model)
- **Growth metric:** Subscriptions growing 40% year-over-year for two years

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Vanilla Ruby on Rails
- **Frontend:** Plain JavaScript, HTML, CSS (avoiding heavy frameworks)
- **Search:** Elasticsearch and FAISS
- **Data Science:** Python ecosystem

Rubel emphasizes simplicity prevented complexity-related headaches.

## Critical Lessons

**Focus Over Diversification:** Spreading across seven side projects during early years delayed growth. "If I had poured all that time into growing what was already showing promise, we'd probably be 10x the size today."

**Hire Strategically:** "The moment I realized I could spend money to hire experts 100x better than myself, the business took off, my stress levels lowered, and the business grew."

**User Validation:** Building in isolation without customer feedback wastes effort. "They won't show up without a plan to reach them, and not without proof your product solves real problems."

**Smart Monetization:** Early undercharging was a mistake. The team now conducts extensive pricing tests tracking churn rates and customer cohorts.

## Future Direction

Rubel declined Envato's acquisition offer in 2020, preferring continued independence. He and Gamble retain 100% ownership.
