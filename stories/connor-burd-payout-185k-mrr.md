## Story Overview

Connor Burd transformed a curiosity-driven hobby into a sustainable mobile app business. Starting with an app idea he wrote down in the middle of the night, he gradually built momentum by creating multiple consumer subscription apps with strong distribution strategies.

## Key Lessons

### 1. Distribution First, Product Second
"Build for distribution first." Rather than perfecting a product in isolation, Connor validated existing audiences before full development. For Payout specifically, he researched TikTok trends and partnered with an influencer, shaping the product around their validated audience.

### 2. Single-Product Focus Drives Better Decisions
Managing a portfolio works best when "focusing on one project at a time" enhances decision-making quality and business understanding.

### 3. Double Down Early on Working Signals
Instead of broad experimentation, Connor identified what generated traction and committed resources there.

### 4. Leverage Existing Audiences
Partner with creators who already have engaged audiences. "Hyper-growth without hyper-spend" through influencer marketing.
