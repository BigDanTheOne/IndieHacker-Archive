## Background

Former optician from France who taught himself to code. Started with a desire for freedom -- working near the Swiss border, he'd stare at the airport yearning to travel.

## Revenue Breakdown

- StoryShort.ai: ~$20,000/month
- UseArtemis.co: ~$5,000/month
- Capacity.so: ~$3,000/month (new, growing)

## First Venture

MathPlanner was deliberately non-technical -- actual workers in India and Bangladesh performed automation tasks behind a simple WordPress landing page. Despite its simplicity, it scaled to $30,000 monthly, validating entrepreneurial instincts.

## Key Lessons

1. **Validation Before Building** -- "Don't build anything before validating demand." Check search volume, SEO metrics, competitors, and distribution pathways.
2. **Choose Strategic Battles** -- Focus on sustainable channels (SEO, YouTube) rather than competing with funded competitors on paid ads.
3. **Data-Driven Intuition** -- "Trust intuition, but verify it with data."
4. **Leverage AI Tools Wisely** -- Use AI to accelerate MVP development without skipping technical literacy.
5. **Recurring Revenue Model** -- All products use subscriptions for predictable growth.

## Growth Channels

- SEO: Described as the "strongest growth channel" for long-term compounding
- Paid Ads: Predictable, scalable traffic for validation

## Tech Stack

Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Vercel, AWS.
