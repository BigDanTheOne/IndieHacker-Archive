## Overview

NativePHP enables PHP/Laravel developers to build desktop and mobile applications without learning new languages. Simon discovered PHP could run without a web server -- something most developers thought impossible.

## The Journey

Simon took voluntary redundancy in late 2022 with minimal runway. In 2023, he created a proof-of-concept using statically compiled PHP with Tauri. Marcel Pociot from the Laravel community spotted his Twitter post and proposed collaboration. They announced NativePHP at Laracon US in 2023 for desktop apps.

The persistent community question: "When will it support mobile?"

Simon submitted conference talks on "Building mobile apps with PHP" as motivation to finish. After repeated rejections, Laracon EU accepted. He worked intensively -- 6am starts, often sleeping at 2-3am -- solving three critical challenges: compiling PHP for iOS, enabling PHP-to-native function communication, and securing Apple App Store approval.

**February 2025:** Launched NativePHP for Mobile and released the first Laravel-built iPhone app on the App Store.

## Business Strategy

**Early Access Program:** Charged $250 discounted price before full launch, using payment as a value proxy.

**Community Investment:** Spent ~10% of gross revenue sponsoring meetups, podcasts, and open-source projects.

**Conference Launch:** Live-coded and compiled an app on stage at Laracon EU, creating dramatic proof-of-concept visibility.

## Key Lessons

- Release early -- don't sit on building for months
- Charge quickly -- don't overcomplicate getting payments in place
- Do unscalable things initially; automate later
- Validate with your target customers, not relatives
- Don't chase social media -- share strategically then close the app
- Partner wisely
- Keep day income during the grind
