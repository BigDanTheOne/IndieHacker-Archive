## Background

Iron abandoned a short-lived finance career. He co-founded Fiks (internship marketplace, 100K ARR) before pivoting to join technical co-founder Adriaan van Rossum at Simple Analytics, which was generating 10K MRR at the time.

## Key Growth Strategies

**Two-Phase Growth Model:**
1. Manual Phase: Engaging potential users across Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook groups
2. Scalable Phase: SEO-driven growth through alternative-to pages, niche content, backlink acquisition, and programmatic SEO

**Reverse Free Trial:** Users access full features for 14 days regardless of plan tier, then select a tier to continue.

## Essential Lessons

- Prioritize doing non-scalable work initially to acquire first customers
- Learn through mistakes rather than waiting for perfect conditions
- Persistence compounds -- most aspiring entrepreneurs quit before success
- Complementary founder skills (technical + distribution) create multiplier effects

## Advice

"Starting early prevents lifestyle inflation that handcuffs ambitious founders." Focus on "unlocking cofounders' potential" rather than doing everything yourself.
