## The Origin Story

Kristel began her entrepreneurial journey at age 22 as a freelance software tester in London, famously hanging posters in a coworking space that read "I hunt for bugs." After thirteen years of building and iterating, Testlio has evolved into a leading QA platform serving Fortune 500 companies across 150+ countries.

## The Problem

The traditional QA marketplace compensated testers based on bug quantity rather than quality work. This created perverse incentives: "testers wouldn't collaborate" and would "rush to report low-hanging fruit bugs" instead of conducting thorough testing.

## The Solution

Kristel reimagined crowdsourced QA by:
- Prioritizing quality over volume through rigorous vetting of testers
- Regional compensation based on task complexity rather than bug counts
- Targeting premium clients willing to pay for experienced professionals
- Aligning incentives with meaningful work rather than speed

## Growth Strategy

**Early phase:** Organic growth through direct outreach and community building

**Recent expansion:** Intentional marketing and sales efforts including working with quality-focused brands (Netflix mentioned specifically), expanding into AI testing services, and building a natural pipeline as testers advance into management roles.

## Key Lessons

**Scaling while maintaining quality:** "Not a problem you solve once" but requires continuous refinement across geographies, devices, and languages.

**Personal reflection:** "Every misstep and failure got me here. But if I had to start over, I'd lean even more into my intuition and speak up sooner."

## Advice for Entrepreneurs

- Build networks and communities for support during challenging phases
- Identify broken systems and create better alternatives
- Focus on genuine value creation and collaboration rather than competing solely on price
- Stay curious and continuously seek improvement opportunities
