## Background

Wohle is a computer science graduate who founded his first company at age 16. His previous venture, SuperAwesome, became a leading kids' technology platform and was acquired by Epic Games (Fortnite's creator). After the exit, he invested in approximately 50 education companies as an angel investor.

## The Pivot to AI

When ChatGPT emerged, Wohle shifted Mindstone's focus entirely toward generative AI adoption. The company now builds an AI adoption platform targeting non-technical professionals at organizations ranging from 200+ employees to major corporations like Hyatt, Pearson, and EBSCO.

## Core Product

The AI Competency Program -- a 10-hour course delivered over four weeks. Typically doubles AI usage within participating organizations.

## Key Lessons

**On Learning Psychology:** "Most people don't like learning" in the traditional sense. Successful adoption requires framing learning as a means to achieve specific goals with visible progress markers.

**On Product-Market Fit:** The company spent three years building before commercializing. Success came only after embracing a hybrid live-async model -- counterintuitive for a software engineer seeking infinite scalability, yet essential for educational effectiveness.

**On Leadership Vision:** "Don't lean into consensus." Strong directional clarity outperforms diluted alignment.

**On Community Growth:** Starting as informal demo meetups in London, Mindstone built "the world's largest practical AI community," now hosting live events across 11+ cities. This community became the primary growth engine.

## Tech Stack

Backend: Go. Frontend: JavaScript. Infrastructure: Google Cloud.
