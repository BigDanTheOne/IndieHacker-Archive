## Overview

## Journey

Aggarwal studied computer systems engineering and initially pursued product management roles. Starting in 2020, he balanced content creation with full-time employment, creating videos about emerging AI tools. By late 2020, his Synthesia AI video went viral.

**On Pricing Strategy:** Prompt-Genie moved from $3.99 to $5.99 to $9, with conversion improvements when removing credit card requirements for trials.

**On Momentum:** Prioritize maintaining momentum post-launch and focus exclusively on user-valued features.

## Growth Strategies

- Social media content marketing (primary growth driver)
- 12-week email course for list building with subtle product promotion
- AI user-generated content (avatars with product demos)
- Localized SEO efforts

## Advice

"If we launch a product, we can get hundreds of users on launch with $0 marketing spend" -- the power of building an audience first.
