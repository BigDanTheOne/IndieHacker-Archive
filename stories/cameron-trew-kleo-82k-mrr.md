## Background

Cameron quit a Senior Engineering role at major tech companies (Elastic Path, Base, Vonage) earning a high salary in London's Canary Wharf. Despite professional success, he felt unfulfilled. Moved back with his parents and started exploring business ideas.

## The Journey

Kleo 1.0 was a free Chrome extension with 60k users before receiving a cease-and-desist from LinkedIn. Cameron rebuilt it as a paid SaaS in 4 weeks using AI-assisted development.

## Revenue Milestones

- Beta pricing: 500 spots at $59/month (sold out in 4 days)
- Second batch: 500 spots at $79/month (sold out in 9 days)
- Standard pricing: $99/month
- Enterprise plan: For agencies with unlimited team members

## Critical Success Factors

**Distribution Strategy:**
- Leveraged co-founders' combined 480k+ LinkedIn followers (Jake Ward: 180k, Lara Acosta: 300k+)
- Hosted 3 pre-launch webinars generating $5k+ each
- Built on existing trust from 60k Kleo 1.0 users
- No paid ads or Product Hunt launch

## Core Lessons

1. **"Distribution first."** Find audiences with existing reach before building.
2. **"Build something you actually use."** Ensuring real pain points are understood.
3. **"Ship fast, then listen."** Released working v2 in 4 weeks then iterated.
4. **AI as Force Multiplier:** Claude Code enabled solo development speed previously requiring teams. Required 10+ years coding experience to effectively leverage.
5. **Ruthless Prioritization:** Single list, work top-to-bottom. No complicated project management.

## Tech Stack

Next.js, TypeScript, Claude (AI), Vercel, Neon (database), Clerk (auth).
