## Founder Journey

Sam Shepler began his entrepreneurial career inspired by Tim Ferriss's The Four Hour Workweek. He co-founded Skyscope Creative, a video production agency that peaked at $750k revenue before acquisition by Matter Communications. After the non-compete period ended, he recognized the agency model's limitations.

## Business Evolution

**Phase 1 - Generalist Agency:** Skyscope Creative faced typical agency problems: "always having fires to deal with, feast and famine cycles, relying purely on referrals."

**Phase 2 - Productized Services:** Shepler identified testimonial video production as a high-demand, repetitive service and launched Testimonial Hero, "unbundling" it from the broader agency offering.

**Phase 3 - Tech-Enabled Services:** As revenue approached several million dollars, tech enablement became essential. The model combines human service delivery with client-facing portals and internal project management tools.

## Technology Stack

- Custom PM system ("Totopo") built on Bubble.io
- Integration: Zapier, Pipedream, custom code
- Data Management: Airtable
- Storage: Amazon S3
- AI Integration: Claude, OpenAI, Gemini via orchestrated workflows

## Key Business Principles

**Gross Margins:** Shepler emphasizes maintaining 50-60% gross margins: "Your gross margin is your fundamental unit economics. In the war for profitability, your gross margins are the front lines."

**Marketing Strategy:** Rather than betting on single channels, he advocates a "100 golden BBs" approach -- diversifying across SEO, cold email, ads, and partnerships.

**Profitability Focus:** "Surpassed $5M annual revenue, completely bootstrapped, exceeding the rule of 40."

## Strategic Acquisitions

In 2024, Shepler acquired Upshot and Case Study Buddy to expand beyond video testimonials into written case studies. This portfolio diversification led to launching Product Hype for B2B SaaS product marketing videos, achieving $50k monthly revenue within one month.

## Advice for Founders

**Focus Until $1M:** "Until you get to about $1M in revenue, it's generally good advice to pick one -- maybe two -- marketing channels, max."

**Services as Validation:** Services validate market demand faster than pure SaaS and provide customer insights for future product development.

**Mentorship Value:** "1-1 coaching sessions with founders who are exactly where I want to be in 3-5 years has been the biggest force multiplier."
