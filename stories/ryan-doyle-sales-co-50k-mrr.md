## The Story

Ryan Doyle graduated from college, worked a sales job in Palo Alto, then quit to build software on his family farm. His initial project, Magic Sales Bot -- an early GPT-powered cold email writer -- received backing from Y Combinator's Calm Fund. However, rather than purely pursuing the product route, Doyle pivoted to offering a tech-enabled productized service.

## Business Model

Sales.co operates as a lead generation agency with recurring monthly subscriptions ranging from $3,000 to $30,000. The company onboards customers with a $1 trial, then transitions them to full subscription pricing after a week-long setup period.

## Key Lessons

**Service-First Approach:** "Start with services instead of building software in isolation." Working directly with a dozen B2B companies revealed commonalities and actual customer pain points before building any infrastructure.

**Infrastructure Evolution:** Began with manual Airtable workflows and Python/JavaScript automations, gradually scaling into a proprietary system.

**Strategic Pricing:** The $1-to-start model dramatically reduced customer risk while enabling predictable revenue collection.

## Advice

Avoid the trap of building products in a vacuum. Start as a service provider to validate real market demand, then build technology around proven workflows.
