## Overview

Dom Wells transformed from building affiliate websites into founding Onfolio, a publicly traded holding company that acquires small, profitable online businesses. The company currently manages approximately 20 portfolio companies.

## The Journey: Building to Buying

**Early Years:** Dom initially built online businesses while living overseas as an income source. He generated approximately $10,000 monthly through affiliate websites and agency work. After accumulating savings, he discovered that acquiring existing websites offered strong returns comparable to stock investments.

**The Transition:** Rather than continuing to build from scratch, Dom shifted his strategy toward acquisition, purchasing smaller businesses from platforms like Empire Flippers using personal capital.

## Business Model & Strategy

**Target Acquisitions:** Onfolio typically acquires B2B agencies, information product businesses, e-commerce platforms, and marketplaces. Most acquisitions fall in the $1-5 million revenue range.

**Synergy Focus:** The company pursues "1+1=3 acquisitions," seeking immediate value creation beyond revenue combination. "We have some synergies or other instant wins available to us."

**Organizational Structure:** A central leadership team provides strategy and support to individual teams at each portfolio company.

## Going Public

Onfolio went public when generating $1.2 million in annual revenue. The company has since grown to a $12 million run rate, primarily through acquisitions totaling approximately $10 million in spending.

**Pros:** "You get access to a lot of advisors. And a lot of people are motivated to help you or work with you."

**Cons:** Increased scrutiny and expenses slowed progress.

**Lessons Learned:** "If I were to do it again, I'd raise more money at IPO. Either that, or wait until we were more profitable."

## Key Advice

**On Focus:** "Don't keep switching between ideas. The reason you have so many ideas is that you're hungry for success. That's a good thing. But channel it toward one or two things."

**On AI Acquisitions:** Dom cautions investors to develop "a stronger thesis than just buying small companies." Many smaller AI firms lack differentiation and are overpriced.
