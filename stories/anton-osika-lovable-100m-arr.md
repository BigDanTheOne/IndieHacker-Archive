## Background

Osika studied physics at university and worked at CERN before becoming an engineer at Swedish tech companies including Sana and Depict. He created GPT-Engineer as a weekend project, which evolved into Lovable after rebranding and relaunching at Slush in November 2024.

## Core Mission

"The biggest barrier to building businesses is coding. 99% of people have great ideas and can execute on a business, but they don't know how to write code." Lovable addresses this by enabling anyone to transform ideas into functional software within minutes.

## Key Growth Drivers

**Community Focus:** The platform prioritizes maker success through Discord engagement, a 6-week "Shipped" cohort with 6,000+ participants, and Demo Day competitions offering $100k prizes. Word-of-mouth emerged as the strongest acquisition channel.

**Social Media Strategy:** Active founder engagement across platforms amplified distribution, sharing customer stories and AI-related insights.

**Free Weekend Campaign:** Making Lovable free for a weekend generated peak simultaneous usage of 134k builders.

**Timing:** AI capability advancement created perfect market conditions for the platform's launch.

## Critical Lessons

**Pricing as Product:** Initially experimenting extensively, Osika adopted "make it easy to try, obvious to buy." Making collaboration free and consolidating plans -- despite losing $1.5M ARR short-term -- simplified messaging, boosted activation, and reduced friction.

**Location Advantage:** Building in Stockholm leveraged European capital efficiency and concentrated tech talent from companies like Spotify, Miro, and Stripe.

**Team Excellence:** With only 40 employees, Osika emphasizes: "Nothing is more important than the team." Success requires recruiting top talent who believe in the mission and trusting them appropriately.

## Scaling Challenges

GitHub suspended Lovable's app one month post-launch due to suspicious rapid repository creation patterns, temporarily taking down the platform for 500,000 users. Direct CEO contact resolved the issue.

## Future Vision

Osika envisions Lovable as potentially "the most important company ever created in Europe," enabling students, frustrated employees, and ambitious founders to launch businesses in months rather than years.

## Key Metrics

- 2.3M active users across 190+ countries
- 40 employees
- Launched end of 2024, reached $100M ARR within 8 months
