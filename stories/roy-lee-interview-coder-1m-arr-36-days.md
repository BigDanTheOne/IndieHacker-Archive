## Overview

Roy Lee, a Columbia University sophomore, built Interview Coder -- an AI assistant for technical interviews that helps candidates pass coding assessments. The product reached $1M ARR within 36 days of launch.

## Revenue Figures

- Hit $1M ARR within 36 days
- Currently at $110K monthly recurring revenue
- Growing 20% week-over-week
- Operating at approximately 95% profit margins

## Business Model

- Subscription starting at $60/month (increased from initial $20/month)
- Annual subscription at $300/year
- $10 credit refills for additional uses

## Technical Details

Built the core product in 4 days using Electron, React, serverless functions on Vercel, and OpenAI's API. Initial monthly cost was approximately $20.

## Marketing & Growth

"Distribution is king" and "Nothing is as risky as it seems." Roy leveraged controversial viral marketing through public social media posts about using the tool in actual interviews at Meta, Capital One, and TikTok. The product went viral with 50M+ views.

He faced bans from LinkedIn and Reddit but found success on X/Twitter, generating sustained growth through the inherent taboo nature of the product.

## Key Lessons

1. Focus relentlessly on viral distribution once the product works
2. Consider virality potential during the ideation phase
3. Wide funnel tops matter more than optimization early on

## Challenges & Consequences

- Blacklisted from major tech companies
- Faced disciplinary action and potential expulsion from Columbia University
- Account bans on LinkedIn and Reddit
