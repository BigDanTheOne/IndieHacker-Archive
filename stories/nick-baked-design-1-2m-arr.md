## Background

Nick left a $300,000 annual position at Meta with minimal financial cushion -- just $10,000 in savings after spending $100,000 on a wedding and $250,000 on a home down payment. This forced resourcefulness became a catalyst for rapid growth.

## Journey

Before Baked Design, Nick experimented with multiple businesses: a remote house cleaning startup, Movevirtual (staffing company reaching $25k MRR before pivoting), and Local Design Studio ($12k MRR).

## X Strategy & Growth

Nick built an audience through design critiques, creating 50+ redesigns by finding recent posts and delivering feedback within 15-45 minutes. A post achieving 110,000+ impressions led to his first major client -- a $4,317 monthly subscription -- validating the model.

Peak growth: Scaled from $4,317 to $167k/month over 5-6 months.

## Core Strategies

**Audience Building:** "Be around the people who want your product or service and act like a regular person -- never as a brand."

**Sales Approach:** Focused on listening during calls, discussing his Meta experience, researching clients' businesses, and demonstrating design work through Figma history.

**Lead Nurturing:** Every prospect receives a Slack workspace invitation to maintain ongoing contact.

## Tech Stack

Figma, Framer & Webflow, Lottie (animations), Slack.

## Advice

Emphasizes taking things slower to enjoy the process rather than "speed running" success. Stresses authenticity and interpersonal connection over brand positioning.
