## The Story

Alex transitioned from corporate consulting at Accenture to founding Pluto, a travel-insurance startup that reached #2 on Trustpilot before the pandemic destroyed the company. He pivoted to bootstrapping.

The breakthrough came when OpenAI released new embedding models in early 2023. The MVP launched in three weeks with under $1K investment using Bubble and OpenAI. The product allows companies to deploy AI customer support agents integrated with Intercom and Zendesk.

## Key Metrics

- Reached $10K MRR in month four
- Pivoted after stalling
- Achieved $40K MRR six months later
- Gross margins: ~82%
- Churn improved from 9% to 3% with better onboarding
- Processes 75K+ support chats monthly with 2 team members

## Key Lessons

1. **Avoid shiny-object syndrome** -- Early AI model experimentation wasted time
2. **Niche down faster** -- Initial "chat with anything" positioning delayed PMF by 12 months
3. **Clear positioning drives growth** -- Specific copy highlighting "5x cheaper" enabled organic discovery
4. **Growth is inherently messy** -- Long conversion cycles make attribution challenging
5. **Constraints enable focus** -- Limited resources forced prioritization

## Advice

- "Sell value before you write code" through pre-sales or public prototypes
- Chase retained paying users, not vanity metrics
- Reduce social media consumption -- focus beats comparison
- No-code remains viable even alongside AI coding tools
