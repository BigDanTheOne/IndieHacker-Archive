## Background

Entrepreneur from Moldova, now based in Barcelona. Started Designmodo as a blog in 2010; went full-time in 2011 when side income matched his salary.

## Products

- **Designmodo** (email builder with Postcards; website builders Slides & Startup)
- **Siter.io** (no-code freehand website builder)
- **Static.app** (one-click static site hosting)
- **Pulsetic.com** (uptime monitoring with status badges)
- **Unspam.email** (email deliverability testing)
- **Absurd.design** (hand-drawn illustration library)

## Key Lessons

**On Problem Selection:** "Test demand by publishing useful content and freebies, then watch where people struggle."

**On the Near-Fatal Crisis (2015-2017):** WordPress expansion over-hired and built long cycles. Quality lagged, support spiked, refunds increased. Recovery involved returning to core strengths, switching to subscriptions, and adopting strict spending discipline.

**On Decision-Making:** "Data -- not excitement -- drive scope and timelines." Retention serves as the primary success metric.

**On Growth Strategy:** "Lead with value; teach first, sell second." Early distribution came through Twitter and Google Search via practical content and freebies.

## Founder's Advice

- Don't expect overnight success
- Start with a painful problem; deliver first value in minutes
- Build distribution while building the product
- Choose a simple, solo-operable tech stack
- Track activation and retention early
- Treat support as product research
- Protect cash flow, ship experiments, maintain momentum
