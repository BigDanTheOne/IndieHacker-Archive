## Origin Story

Joseph Lee founded Supademo after frustration with explaining products to non-technical audiences in his previous venture (Freshline.io, an e-commerce platform for perishables). He struggled with creating and maintaining videos and slideshows that prospects rarely watched completely.

## Product Overview

Supademo helps companies create interactive product demonstrations for onboarding, sales, marketing, and training. Thousands of paying customers and over 100,000 end users.

## Tech Stack

NextJS, React, TypeScript, Node, PlanetScaleDB, AWS, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Claude, Gemini.

## Key Growth Pillars

**1. Product Craftsmanship:** Avoiding feature bloat while maintaining intuitive design regardless of technical expertise level.

**2. Product-Led Experimentation:** Leveraging ungated experiences and demo-driven SEO strategies.

**3. SEO & Content Strategy:**
- Programmatic top-of-funnel content targeting product search terms
- Creating interactive tutorials and comparison pages
- LinkedIn thought leadership: growth from 10K to 500K+ quarterly impressions

**4. Product Virality:**
- Fully ungated platform ("ultimate 'try before you buy'")
- Free tools like screenshot editors
- Reverse trial access without signup
- A/B testing watermarks and trigger moments

## Core Lessons

"You'll learn faster by doing than analyzing" -- real customer interactions trump planning phases.

On founder-led distribution: "Building in public is great, but tailor your approach for your stage and audience."

Critical advice: "Don't confuse motion with progress." Focus obsessively on selling or building -- measure only core, compound metrics.

## Growth Metrics

- 3x growth in 2025, 8x growth in 2024
