## Background

25 years as a professional developer. Previously CTO at Squidoo (9 years, grew to $10M revenue). Ran a VC-backed crypto startup.

## Product

Subscribr is an AI-powered tool helping YouTube creators plan video ideas, develop content packaging, and structure scripts.

## Growth Trajectory

- $10K MRR reached within 100 days of launch
- $500K+ generated in first year
- On track for $1M+ in year two

## Key Strategies

**Validation:** Built an email list of 1,000 through X engagement, mini-apps, and industry reports. Presold 50 lifetime subscriptions, raising $20K+ upfront.

**Growth Channels:** X hyperactivity and giveaways (early), SEO content (long-term), ChatGPT organic traffic, Google/Meta ads, AppSumo lifetime deals, affiliate program.

**Cofounder Addition:** After 18 months solo, brought on a cofounder with a 15K+ subscriber YouTube channel. Revenue increased 50% in the first month.

## Key Lessons

1. **Market Selection Matters Most** -- "You will live and die by the strength of the market you serve."
2. **Real Validation = Money** -- "Surveys and interest signals mean little compared to actual transactions."
3. **De-Risk Systematically** -- No employment change, no fundraising before proven CAC, no premature hiring.
4. **Bootstrapped Founder Economics** -- A $1M annual profit from solo operation typically exceeds a VC-backed CEO's take-home.
5. **Flow State Over Systems** -- Avoids rigid OKRs; works on what feels important daily.

## Tech Stack
