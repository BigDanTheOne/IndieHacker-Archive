## The Story

Ivan never intended to start a business. In 2012, he spent a week creating a web-based Photoshop PSD file viewer as a student project, working roughly 10 hours monthly. He kept developing it purely because people responded positively, with no monetization strategy initially.

The product remained free for five years. By 2017, with 5,000 daily visitors, Ivan introduced advertisements and premium accounts. Today, 90% of revenue comes from ads, while 10% derives from premium subscriptions and licensing deals.

## Key Metrics

- ~1M daily active users
- Operating costs: ~$20/year for domain, $600 for hosting
- Solo operation for 13 years
- All code written personally by Ivan

## Revenue Model

Ivan's approach focuses on "removing friction" rather than aggressive paywalls. The core product remains free, allowing organic growth through word-of-mouth and search visibility. Premium accounts remove advertisements.

## Technical Philosophy

The tech stack emphasizes simplicity: JavaScript files, GLSL code for GPU acceleration, and minimal PHP for user account management. The entire application runs as JavaScript downloaded to users' browsers, requiring minimal server resources.

## Growth Strategy

Growth occurred organically through:
- Initial submission to Google Experiments (10-20 daily visitors)
- Blog mentions and natural sharing
- Reddit AMAs that generated significant user acquisition
- Gradual SEO improvements

Ivan emphasizes he "didn't have a development phase or big release" -- he launched with 1% of current features and iterated monthly.

## Solopreneur Perspective

Despite 13 years of solo operation, Ivan resists converting Photopea into a scalable company. He acknowledged initially hating working alone but discovered that "others probably wouldn't enjoy it as much" and he wouldn't enjoy managing them. He declined acquisition offers, preferring independence.

## Key Lessons

1. Education matters -- credits his technical education as foundational
2. Action over planning -- spend time experimenting with multiple concepts
3. Trust your instincts -- "If some decision feels wrong to you, just refuse it"
4. Value-first approach -- build what's genuinely useful; monetization follows naturally
