## The Journey

Ben Aston began in 2001 with a satirical student publication that taught him about community building. After a decade in London's digital agencies, he launched a blog about project management in 2011 -- initially a side project that evolved into The Digital Project Manager.

Recognizing a larger opportunity, Aston built an ecosystem of 15+ niche media brands including People Managing People and The Product Manager, each targeting specific professional audiences with millions of monthly visitors.

## Business Model

The company operates three core revenue pillars:

1. **Revleads** (proprietary AdTech platform) connecting B2B SaaS vendors with high-intent professional audiences
2. **Revstacks** (PubTech platform) providing monetization infrastructure for publishers and communities
3. **Professional development** through courses and paid memberships

## Key Lessons

**Build Trust First:** Aston emphasizes creating "tactical, real-world advice" that audiences genuinely value before monetizing. The company maintains "no hacks, no fluff; just useful stuff from lived experience."

**Audience-Driven Growth:** Rather than paid acquisition, BWZ grew through evergreen, intent-driven content that solved recurring professional needs. The approach compounds over years through organic search visibility.

**Execution Matters Most:** "Good ideas are easy. Great execution is rare." Aston stresses that vision without operational discipline yields nothing.

**Embrace Your Technology Roots:** Initially viewing themselves as a content business, the team discovered greater leverage by building proprietary tech infrastructure rather than relying on external tools.

**Strong Opinions, Lightly Held:** Maintain conviction while remaining flexible. "Stay close to the problem, and be willing to change your solution as you learn more."

## Growth Challenges

During COVID-era rapid scaling, hiring inexperienced managers diluted quality. This led to misaligned content that didn't match user intent, resulting in losing nearly one-third of revenue. Aston recovered by refocusing on audience insights and value delivery.

## Monetization Philosophy

The company built advertising experiences that serve audiences, not just vendors. Rather than "junk programmatic ads," BWZ creates contextual placements where professionals actively research solutions -- ensuring "the response isn't 'ugh, another ad.' It was, 'Oh good, I was looking for a tool like this.'"

## Future Vision

Aston aims to expand Revstacks into the creator economy, establish serious-yet-fun as a professional development standard, build the most-loved career ecosystem in digital media, and help SaaS vendors reach buyers more efficiently.
