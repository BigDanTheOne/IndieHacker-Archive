## The Story

Benson launched 750 Words in 2009 as a simple journaling tool encouraging daily three-page brain dumps. The platform evolved from free to donation-supported (2010) to membership-based (2014) at $5-$10/month pricing.

For over a decade, the product languished in "maintenance mode" while Benson worked at Twitter, Slack, Patreon, and Medium. Despite minimal attention, 750 Words quietly grew through organic search and user loyalty. The domain even expired once for a full day.

In October 2024, Benson quit his job to focus full-time on scaling from $21K to his target of $50K monthly.

## Advice

"Get your values straight and build something that, if it becomes successful, you'll be proud of."

"The inner delight and pride of having built something that feels like a true and authentic contribution to the world... is the only success that feels worth the cost of all the work."
