## The Journey

After his first app (an SEC-registered robo-advisor) failed catastrophically, Khasanov drained savings, maxed credit cards, and went into debt. Rather than quit, he rebuilt by creating database products solving specific founder pain points. Angel Match emerged from his personal frustration finding investors.

## Key Lessons

1. **Chase Painful Problems, Not Shiny Ideas** -- Look for workflows people solve with spreadsheets
2. **Ship Minimal Viable Products** -- Launch basic versions quickly to validate willingness to pay
3. **Own Customer Support** -- Direct user conversations reveal invaluable product insights
4. **Leverage Organic Growth** -- "SEO takes time and effort, but eventually works on autopilot"
5. **Build Moat-Worthy Solutions** -- Curated databases survive market disruptions better than AI wrappers
6. **Don't Quit Early** -- Persistence through unproductive periods separates successful founders

## Core Advice

- Avoid expensive, complex businesses requiring VC funding
- Test many small solutions to find product-market fit
- Implement programmatic SEO for database products
- Build free tools as lead magnets and organic traffic drivers
- Stay consistent; success compounds over years, not months
