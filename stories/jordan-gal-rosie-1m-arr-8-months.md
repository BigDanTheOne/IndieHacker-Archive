## Background

Jordan previously ran Rally, a VC-funded company that stalled at "a few hundred thousand in ARR." When AI emerged, he decided to pivot rather than continue struggling.

## Finding the Opportunity

Instead of copying successful products, Jordan identified AI voice as an emerging category where "these voice solutions just don't sound good at all." He viewed poor existing solutions as a positive signal -- any immature AI category would inevitably improve.

Strategy shifted toward SMBs like local service companies and retail businesses, prioritizing self-serve, low-friction, low-cost solutions.

## Building Phase (90 Days)

- Team: Reduced to 6 people
- Prioritized speed and quality infrastructure over features
- Partnered with Bland.ai for AI voice backbone
- Tech Stack: Laravel
- First customer: ~120 days after development started

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Cold Email (Month 1-2)
1,000 emails daily for ~2 months. Goal: rapid customer feedback, not efficiency.

### Paid Advertising (Primary Growth Engine)
Meta and Google ads became the main customer acquisition channel. "Really surprised that ads worked for us."

**Critical Lesson:** A Google PMax campaign appeared successful but converted at lower rates post-signup. "Make sure you track what happens after signup."

## Pricing

- Base tier: $49/month (only option initially)
- Multi-location businesses converted into larger contracts despite low entry price

## Key Decisions & Lessons

**Lean team mentality despite VC funding:** "I think my experience bootstrapping saas startups previously was very helpful. I just went back to that mindset."

**Speed over perfection:** 90 days to MVP

**Customer demand focus:** "All I care about is customer demand"

## Parting Advice

"Whatever you think you need to start, you need less. Don't give yourself excuses that get in the way of getting started."

"Many of my mistakes were mimetic in nature" -- don't replicate others' playbooks blindly.
