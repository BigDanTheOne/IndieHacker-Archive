## The Origin Story

In 2009, at age 23, Stoddart achieved sobriety and moved to Florida. Inspired by Seth Godin's advice, he started Sober Nation, a blog documenting his recovery journey through daily writing. The site gained significant organic traffic.

## Business Evolution

### Phase 1: Media Brand (Sober Nation)
Rather than monetizing through traditional ads, Stoddart launched Stodzy Internet Marketing -- an SEO agency targeting behavioral health facilities. He leveraged Sober Nation's audience as his lead generation funnel, generating millions in revenue before selling his stake.

### Phase 2: Holding Company
**Cash Flow Engine:** Quantum Leads (high-ticket agency services): $1M/year

**Holdings Under Blue and Hazel Holdings ($400K/year):**
- Copyblogger.com: $740K acquisition, generates six figures annually
- Sober Nation: $200K/year through lead generation
- Treatment center investments
- ConvertKit investment

## Key Business Principles

"You don't get paid for what you do, you get paid for what you own." Uses his agency as both revenue generator and investment de-risking tool.

**Equity deal structure:** Invests capital while having the target company become a Quantum Leads client, earning both equity upside and service fees.

## Core Advice

**On Writing:** "Write every day. Don't let AI steal your brain."

**On Scaling:** "10X thinking" -- targeting high-end markets where competition is sparse and deal sizes are larger, generating 3X more revenue for less effort.

**On Leverage:** The breakthrough was generating strategic leverage through asset ownership and thoughtful positioning.
