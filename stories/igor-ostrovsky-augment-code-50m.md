## Background

Igor grew up in Slovakia during the late 1980s, learning programming on a Czechoslovak PMD-85 and later a Commodore 64. After studying computer science at UBC and competing in programming competitions, he spent eight years building distributed-storage systems at Pure Storage.

In late 2021, Igor left his stable position to explore large-language models. His wife encouraged the risk: "Give it a chance -- you can always go back to storage."

## Core Strategy: Two "Big Rocks"

**1. Context Engine:** A real-time index handling multi-branch updates, millisecond latency, and codebases with hundreds of thousands of files.

**2. Custom Code-Completion Model:** In 2022, quality code LLMs were scarce, so the team trained their own model before strong open-source alternatives existed.

Igor deliberately resisted early UI polish, prioritizing "hard AI and systems work" to enable everything else to scale later.

## Build For Next Year Philosophy

The central thesis: "Every software epoch has its platform shifts, but AI moves faster than anything we've seen before."

Mobile and cloud evolved on five-year cycles; large-language models generate "one or two genuine waves per year -- retrieval-augmented chat in 2023, interactive agents in 2024, something new already brewing for 2025."

The job is to "ship for the current wave while secretly building foundations for the next one."

## Technical Stack

- **Languages:** Go, Python, Rust
- **Architecture:** Microservices on Kubernetes with gRPC
- **Client Apps:** VS Code Extension, JetBrains Plugin, Vim/NeoVim
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

## Go-to-Market: "Try First" Model

Rather than complex token-based pricing, Augment charges per successful user message. 14-day unlimited free trial, no sales call required.

"There is so much hype in AI, that we want teams to try Augment so they can see the difference our Context Engine makes for large codebases."

## Key Lessons

**Deep Understanding Across Three Dimensions:**
- Understand the technology deeply
- Know the customer intimately
- Understand the market thoroughly

**Bet Forward:** "Yesterday's cutting-edge will commoditize in months; plan for the model you expect to exist a year from now."

**Rapid Learning Loops:** Joining open-source research communities and building directly accelerated learning far more than any book could.
