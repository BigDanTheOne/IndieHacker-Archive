## Origin Story

Boucher began coding at age 10, achieving six-figure monthly e-commerce revenue by 18. Seeking something more sustainable and meaningful, he pivoted to SaaS. He identified attendance tracking as a pain point in higher education -- students and staff manually signed attendance sheets twice daily.

## Product Evolution

Edusign evolved beyond basic attendance tracking into "a student experience platform" that centralizes tools, reduces administrative workload, and improves institutional image.

## Key Growth Strategies

**User Research:** Boucher conducted 100+ interviews to understand the actual problem. Early positioning focused not on digitization but on "an assurance that schools would get their funding" and time savings.

**Marketing Mix:**
- SEO: 40-50% (declined from 95% early on)
- Outbound: Growing to 20%
- Partners: 15%
- Events/webinars: 5%
- Advertising: 2-5%

**Early Advantages:** "You only have that strength as a very small team" regarding exceptional customer support and responsiveness. Despite numerous bugs, high NPS scores resulted from genuine human engagement.

## Critical Lessons

**What Worked:**
- Extreme proximity to customers ("literally inside a classroom")
- "Doing things that don't scale" early on
- Prioritizing UX over perfection
- Founder-led support creating compound customer loyalty

**Mistakes Acknowledged:**
- Building unnecessary features
- Poor hiring decisions
- Misaligned priorities
- Adding product lines prematurely
