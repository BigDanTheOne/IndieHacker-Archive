## Business Overview

Magier is a subscription design service launched two years ago. Despite the founder's lack of design background, the company provides on-demand creative work for premium brands through fixed monthly retainers ranging from $2,500-$5,000, generating 90% of revenue.

## Origin Story

Fleitmann identified a persistent problem across his entrepreneurial ventures: companies struggled to find reliable design capacity. He validated the concept in one weekend by launching a basic landing page and securing three paying clients within a week -- before hiring any designers.

## Revenue Model

- Subscription Focus (90%): Monthly design and Webflow packages at fixed rates
- Project Work (10%): One-time rebrandings, pitch decks, development tasks

## Growth Trajectory

- $0-$20k MRR: Personal network and cold email outreach
- $20k-$80k MRR: Primarily referrals from satisfied clients
- $80k-$200k MRR: Three main distribution channels

## Key Growth Channels

**1. SEO Strategy:** Over 100 published articles targeting funnel keywords; weekly releases.

**2. YouTube Channel:** 3-5 videos weekly on marketing, design, and Webflow. Content compounds over time with "longevity no other platform offers."

**3. Personal Branding:** Four team members create consistent LinkedIn content. Generated 5M+ impressions and tens of thousands of interactions annually.

## Core Lessons

**On Starting:** "Don't overthink -- just start doing and figure it out along the way."

**On Distribution:** "The most important thing in building a company is distribution."

**On Positioning:** Regrets starting too broad. A more specific niche would have simplified operations and client acquisition.

**On Subscription Models:** Recurring revenue eliminates the unpredictability of one-time payment businesses.

## 2025 Goals

- Revenue target: $200k MRR
- Team expansion: 50 people (currently 30)
- Demo calls increase: 50+ monthly (currently ~25)
