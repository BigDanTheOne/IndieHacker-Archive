## Business Overview

Brady Lowe transitioned from hospitality into founding Taste Network, a growth agency serving entrepreneurs in culinary, hospitality, and events sectors. Three integrated revenue models:

1. **Taste Network** - Full-service growth agency with high-ticket coaching
2. **NEXT10** - $4.5K-$10K scaling program for entrepreneurs
3. **Accelerator** - $2.5K/month done-with-you service for operators seeking systems

## Key Business Pillars

**Clarity:** "Clarity creates momentum" through North Star visioning, helping leaders define 3-5 year objectives and build backward from that vision.

**Systems:** Converting "messy wins into repeatable systems" through SOPs and playbooks ensures consistency and scalability without chaos.

**Community:** Building stakeholder relationships transforms customers into brand advocates, creating resilience that transcends individual leadership.

## Growth Strategies

The "Sell by Chat" playbook involves daily prospect DMs with structured follow-ups and strategy call escalation. "Relationship equity comes first."

## Critical Learnings

Contracts lack enforceability without adequate financial resources and legal capacity to defend them. Understand this reality early.

## Two Primary Success Factors

1. North Star visioning -- understanding destination and identity transformation
2. Reinvestment discipline -- allocating 15% of revenue toward coaching and systems acceleration

## Tech Stack

GoHighLevel, Flodesk, Instagram, Zoom, Loom, Google Suite.
