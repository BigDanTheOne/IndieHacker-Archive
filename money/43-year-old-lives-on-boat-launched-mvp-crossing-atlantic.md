## Overview

Thomas Wink, a 43-year-old Dutch-South African founder, completed his MVP for MARQT AI -- a market research tool -- while sailing solo across the Atlantic Ocean from Colombia to the Azores. This four-week, 3,780 nautical mile journey exemplifies his unconventional approach to entrepreneurship and life.

## Key Financial Details

**MARQT AI (Product Revenue: $0 at launch)**
- Development costs (4 months): $3,510 (APIs) + $564 (VMs)
- Monthly operating costs: ~$147.50
- Microsoft Azure Partner credits: $25,000
- Team: Thomas, a marketing specialist co-founder, and a designer

**Personal Finances**
- Personal savings: $5,000
- Freelance business account: $3,000
- Investments: $12,000 (dividend funds) + $900 (crypto)
- Monthly expenses: ~$1,250 (boat maintenance, travel, insurance, food, internet, clothing)

## Business Journey

**Origins:** Thomas began as an online chandlery seller in the early 2000s, building an ERP system with webshop functionality. He describes receiving organic search traffic "within two weeks of going live" and initially felt like "a true entrepreneur." After five years, burnout led him to sell the business.

**Current Ventures:** He combines freelance full-stack development with building MARQT AI, which aims to "democratize market research" for startups and scale-ups.

## Philosophy and Lifestyle Insights

**On Money:** Thomas evolved from worshipping money to despising it, now finding balance. He states that "time is really the most precious currency in life."

**On Risk:** He skips most insurance beyond mandatory government coverage, believing excessive insurance reflects "sad" risk-aversion that prevents people from enjoying vacations.

**On Property:** Rather than following conventional wisdom to purchase real estate, he invested in his boat -- a decision he considers superior for his values.

**On Work-Life Integration:** The adventurous lifestyle required navigating challenges; he had to escape from Hurricane Beryl and nearly hit a dead whale approaching the Azores.

## Financial Strategy

- **Bootstrapping preference:** Thomas favors independence but acknowledges that venture capital could provide competitive advantage in the SaaS market
- **Investment approach:** Shifted from short-term trades to dividend funds, achieving approximately 10% returns
- **Frugal living:** Described as potentially "the worst consumer," leveraging secondhand purchases and personal boat maintenance skills learned at a shipyard

## Key Advice

Thomas illustrates that unconventional paths -- living affordably, maintaining location independence, and prioritizing autonomy -- enable sustained entrepreneurial effort while preserving personal fulfillment that traditional employment cannot provide.
