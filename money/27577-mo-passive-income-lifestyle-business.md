## About Tamir Bashkin

Tamir Bashkin, 35, has never held traditional employment. After reading Tim Ferriss's *4-Hour Work Week* while serving in Israeli military intelligence, he committed to building passive income streams. He spent his twenties developing lifestyle businesses designed to generate revenue with minimal ongoing effort.

## Revenue Breakdown

- **Thank You GPT** (AI-powered messaging tool): $2,580/month
- **ClearSight** (cybersecurity platform): $0 (recently launched)
- **Adelante** (Zendesk consultancy): ~$25,000/month
- **Total Monthly Income:** $27,577
- **Business reserves:** ~$250,000
- **Personal savings:** ~$5,000

## Business Philosophy

Bashkin emphasizes that "your business should work for you -- not the other way around." He prioritizes high-leverage, low-cost initiatives and avoids hourly work traps. No-code tools allow him to test concepts within 30 days before committing resources.

## Monthly Expenses

**Business Operations:**
- Salaries/freelancers: $7,000-$10,000
- Office rent/utilities: $500
- Software/tools: $1,500
- Content/copywriting: $700
- Miscellaneous: $2,500

**Personal Expenses (split with partner):**
- Housing: $2,000
- Pet medical care: $300
- Food/transportation: $1,200

## Tax Strategy

Bashkin strategically limits his personal salary to $4,000 monthly -- Israel's optimal tax threshold. Additional profits accumulate in business accounts for future opportunities, effectively providing $10,000 monthly compensation when factoring in retained earnings.

## Investment Approach

Beginning in 2018, Bashkin adopted a passive investment strategy focused exclusively on S&P 500 index funds (VOO and VUAA). He contributes $1,200 monthly to his IRA pension account. His portfolio has generated approximately 60% returns. He deliberately avoids individual stocks and cryptocurrency, viewing them as unnecessarily time-intensive.

He keeps substantial cash reserves because: "I'm trying to ensure that every dollar I have is working to create more money." His $250,000 business reserve earns 8% annually (~$20,000) in a cash-based mutual fund while remaining available for acquisition opportunities.

## Key Lessons

- Understand your tax jurisdiction thoroughly
- Balance frugality with strategic spending: "Sometimes, you need to spend twice as much as you're spending now to earn ten times more"
- Travel strategically for perspective and planning breakthroughs
- Treat business as the primary wealth-building vehicle while keeping personal investments conservative

## Future Plans

Bashkin plans larger bets on acquiring CRM applications (~$40,000 each) to transform them into enterprise-grade products through SOC2/GDPR compliance modifications, targeting 10x markup potential.
