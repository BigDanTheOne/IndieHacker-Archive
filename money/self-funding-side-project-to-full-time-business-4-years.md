## About Damjan Dano

Damjan Dano, a 36-year-old entrepreneur, transitioned from running a successful service company for 17 years to building Aqtos, a business operating system (BOSS) designed for small business management.

## Background

Dano earned his first online income in 7th grade through a referral program ($20-30) and his first substantial income at $100 designing a website using Dreamweaver. He subsequently built profitable IT service businesses that still generate annual dividends.

## The Pivot

In 2018, while managing a major cryptocurrency exchange project, Dano experienced burnout from the repetitive cycle of client acquisition and project delivery. He decided to create something scalable rather than continuing the service-based grind.

## Product Details

Aqtos functions as a comprehensive all-in-one platform offering task management, HR, chat, calendar, invoicing, expense tracking, website monitoring, and sales pipeline management. Dano emphasizes the product as "heavily opinionated" software that combines tools with business wisdom.

## Development Timeline

- Initially launched as a side project (twice without success)
- January 2024: Committed fully to the venture
- Currently in public rollout phase with 200+ early access requestees

## Financial Breakdown

**Revenue:**
- Aqtos MRR: $500
- Dividends from previous business: "Decent annual salary by US standards"
- Founder personal compensation: $0
- Personal bank account status: Severely strained

**Monthly Expenses:**
- Payroll: $15,000 (team of 15 including 7 full-time, 8 part-time)
- Maintenance: $1,000
- Software/tech: $4,000
- **Total: $20,000/month**

Personal expenses cited as substantial, with childcare (twins in kindergarten) and cooking/culinary experimentation noted as significant costs.

## Investment Philosophy

Dano actively invests beyond his business, favoring tech stocks including FAAMG, NVDA, and TSLA rather than index funds. He also invests in media companies and real estate. Aqtos serves as his retirement strategy with minimal national pension contributions.

## Key Principles

Dano emphasizes quality over speed, rejecting the prevailing "ship fast" mentality. He states: "We really need quality products" and believes real value delivery requires genuine earning, not shortcuts.

Regarding slow development, he argues this approach suits complex industries. He created ToVCorNot, a tool helping founders evaluate venture capital, reflecting his nuanced position on external funding.

## Personal Philosophy

- Avoids excessive financial micromanagement, focusing instead on the bigger picture
- Invests substantially in personal enrichment (travel, culinary equipment -- recently purchased a $350 Le Creuset dish)
- Dismisses materialism while valuing experiences and self-improvement

## Advice for Founders

Dano encourages aspiring entrepreneurs to "get your priorities straight and develop something that matters to you." He advises ignoring "MRR porn" and generic startup advice, advocating instead for authentic commitment: "You do you."

He emphasizes persistence through difficult periods and maintaining vision despite external pressures and inevitable failures.
