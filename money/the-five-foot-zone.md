Colban uses a swimming metaphor to describe the exhausting limbo of half-commitment to side projects. The "five-foot zone" represents standing on tiptoes in shallow water -- technically safe but physically and mentally draining.

## The Core Problem

The author describes being "five feet deep -- not swimming, not sinking, not floating" as a state where entrepreneurs maintain one foot in their job while pursuing dreams. She notes this creates "constant adjusting" and "never fully resting."

## Fear Dynamics

Colban identifies two interconnected fears: fear of failure itself, and deeper fear of "giving it everything...and still come up empty." The psychological weight of this uncertainty keeps many in perpetual planning mode rather than shipping.

## The Real Cost

Rather than lacking courage, she suggests people suffer from "unresolved decision debt." Half-commitment taxes attention and energy more than choosing a direction decisively, whether that means committing fully or walking away entirely.

## Lessons Shared

- Planning instead of building is often disguised fear, not strategy
- The exhaustion comes from maintaining multiple futures simultaneously
- Full commitment means losing the safety net of claiming "this didn't count"
- Support systems matter -- knowing others have survived the leap helps

## Her Experience

Colban quit a job that was "burning me alive" and felt "lighter than I had in months" afterward, though she acknowledges ongoing uncertainty about her non-profit, ShareVita.org.

## Conclusion

She emphasizes: "You can't stay on your tiptoes forever" and advocates for decisive action, supported by community, as the only sustainable path forward.
