## Overview

Afina, a showerhead manufacturer, conducted an A/B test examining whether American consumers would pay a premium for domestically manufactured products. The experiment compared two identical products with different origins and pricing.

## Test Details

**The Setup:**
- **Made in Asia option:** $129 (manufactured in China)
- **Made in USA option:** $239 (manufactured domestically)
- **Sample size:** 25,650 customers
- **Result:** Nearly all customers selected the lower-priced foreign-made option

## Business Context

The company faced a cost challenge following tariff increases of up to 145% on Chinese imports in early April 2025. Exploring domestic manufacturing, they discovered U.S. production costs "tripled" compared to their existing Chinese supplier arrangement. This pricing dilemma prompted the experiment.

## Key Findings

The test revealed a significant gap between stated consumer preferences and actual purchasing behavior. Despite widespread claims supporting American-made goods, the price differential proved determinative in customer decision-making.

## Identified Limitations

The article acknowledges three major experimental flaws:

1. **Pricing gap:** The 85% price increase exceeded typical tariff impacts, making it an unrealistic representation of real-world scenarios

2. **Product differentiation:** Both items were presented as identical except origin and price, whereas actual American-made products typically feature distinct branding, quality positioning, and ethical messaging

3. **Sales channel:** The online test environment heightens price sensitivity due to effortless comparison shopping, unlike physical retail where availability and other factors influence decisions differently

## Broader Implications

The experiment illustrates the persistent tension between consumer rhetoric and purchasing reality, particularly in contexts involving economic trade-offs.
