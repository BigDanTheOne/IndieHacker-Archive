## Previous Venture: CryptEarn

Stefan co-founded CryptEarn with five partners, investing 70+ hours weekly for two years while maintaining other jobs. Despite gaining 4,000 users in five weeks after pivoting, the team burned out and disbanded without monetizing. The company competed in The Founder Games and pursued Soonami's venturethon but ultimately failed.

## Key Philosophy

Stefan emphasizes: "Things aren't expensive, you're just not making enough money." He believes success requires earning more, not restrictive budgeting. His low-cost lifestyle mitigates startup risk, providing psychological freedom: "Just knowing that I won't be financially ruined if something fails is enough for me to keep grinding."

He expects success within 4-5 years and accepts multiple failures as inevitable in entrepreneurship.

## Armor Wallet Strategy

The current project features AI agents completing crypto transactions based on user prompts. Stefan chose this venture because it has "a solid monetizing structure" and clear value proposition -- lessons learned from CryptEarn's shortcomings.

## Investment Approach

Stefan prioritizes high-risk, high-reward crypto investments due to his age, planning to shift toward "get-rich-slow" strategies like mutual funds and real estate in approximately 10 years.

## Advice on Funding

Regarding investor outreach, Stefan suggests: "If a VC thinks you're desperate, they'll run the other way. But if you're bootstrapping...they'll fall head over heels in love with you."

## Travel Hacking

Stefan demonstrates cost-conscious travel, citing 10-day Greek vacations for $400 and Romanian trips for $300 by avoiding peak seasons, booking last-minute, and eating where locals eat.
