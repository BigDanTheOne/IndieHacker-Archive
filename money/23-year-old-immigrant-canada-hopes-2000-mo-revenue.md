## Business Journey

**Early Venture:** At 18, Kathan co-founded a government-funded startup that failed due to weak marketing execution.

**First Success:** His service-based business, Reachactory -- which promoted AI tools to 100+ directories -- generated his first $100 payment after 1.5 months of consistent social media marketing.

**Current Product:** Easy UI offers a freemium model with premium access costing $29 for 50+ high-quality templates. The product had 1,900+ site visitors and 90+ GitHub stars at publication.

## Core Philosophy

Kathan emphasizes solving problems by saving time, automating processes, or providing genuine value. He advocates using AI tools affordably and reinvesting profits rather than paying himself immediately.

**Key Advice:** "Invest in yourself before investing somewhere else" and "Use AI and become rich before it replaces you."

## Lifestyle Approach

He maintains a minimalist lifestyle, avoiding car ownership despite Toronto's high insurance costs, and uses public transportation. Travel serves as educational investment for cultural and culinary exposure.
