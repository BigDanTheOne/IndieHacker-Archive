## About Anshul Gupta

Anshul Gupta, a 37-year-old entrepreneur with 17 years of experience, shares his financial journey building two companies in Luxembourg.

## Career Background

Gupta previously launched India's first OTT platform, DittoTV (now integrated into Zee5). In 2016, he founded Razrtech, a managed services company developing consumer web and mobile products. His first major success came in 2017 when a celebrity social app generated $1 million in revenue, though it eventually declined.

## Current Venture: Socially

Gupta now leads Socially, a subscription-based SaaS platform helping creators and communities build memberships, events, and private groups. The platform serves 200+ communities and 150,000+ users.

**Financial Metrics:**
- Monthly revenue: $12,000-$18,000
- Annual revenue: $1 million (including 2-3 enterprise clients annually)
- Completely bootstrapped from business revenue

**Monthly Expenses:**
- AWS: $2,000
- Team salaries: $7,000
- Tool subscriptions: $500
- Cloudflare annual: $2,200

## Key Financial Philosophy

Gupta emphasizes "a balanced approach -- one where you save smartly but also invest in experiences, learning, and even occasional indulgences -- is key." He advocates that founders must "always pay yourself" to maintain motivation and sustainability.

## Personal Finance Details (Luxembourg-based)

- House mortgage: EUR 1,600/month
- Car lease: EUR 918/month
- Groceries, dining, takeout: EUR 1,500/month

Gupta invests in Magnificent Seven stocks and dividend-paying investments while building pension benefits through Luxembourg's social security system.

## Advice on VC Funding

He recommends pursuing venture capital only when your product operates as an established business requiring growth capital -- not to establish the business itself. Bootstrapping provides longevity, while good VC accelerates market share acquisition.
