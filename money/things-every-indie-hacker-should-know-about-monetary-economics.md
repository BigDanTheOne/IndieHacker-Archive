This educational piece uses simplified language to explain economic fundamentals relevant to startup founders.

## Core Concepts Covered

### Credit's Economic Role

The authors explain that "credit makes the economy move" by enabling businesses and consumers to spend before accumulating sufficient cash. A mortgage example illustrates how borrowing cascades through the economy -- construction companies hire workers, material suppliers gain customers, creating multiplier effects.

### Interest Rates

Interest represents the cost of borrowing. Lower rates encourage more lending and spending; higher rates have the opposite effect. The Federal Reserve sets the Federal Funds Rate approximately eight times annually.

### Inflation Dynamics

When economies overheat, increased spending drives competition for workers, raising wages and prices simultaneously. The thermostat analogy describes the Fed's balancing act: preventing economies from running "too cold" (low activity) or "too hot" (runaway inflation).

## Practical Guidance for Founders

### Low Interest Rate Environments (below 3%)

- Ideal for growth-focused strategies
- Access to affordable capital enables faster scaling
- Opportune moments for borrowing or refinancing

### High Interest Rate Environments (above 5%)

- Focus shifts toward operational efficiency and stability
- Customers face squeezed budgets
- Reduced demand across supply chains

The authors note that even indirectly affected founders experience downstream customer spending reductions.
