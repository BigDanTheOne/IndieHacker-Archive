## Key Lessons and Advice

**On Work-Life Balance:**
> "Money brings independence. That's the purpose of it."

Alupoaie emphasizes that founders with families face unique constraints: "If you're on your own, you can work 16 hours a day, cut all your expenses, and move to a low-cost country. But when you have a family, their needs come first."

**Founder Compensation:**
He rejects the narrative that entrepreneurs must minimize personal income. "If you can't earn enough money from your business to live a decent life, it's not worth it."

**Bootstrapping Philosophy:**
His previous venture accepted angel investment, which he credits as detrimental. He states: "I believe this approach...had a profoundly negative impact on how I approached every decision in the business."

**Starting Strategy -- His Primary Recommendation:**
> "Always start on the side. Never quit your main job to start a new business."

He attributes poor decision-making under financial stress to the "fight-or-flight" neural response that impairs judgment.

**Financial Management Approach:**
Rather than meticulous budgeting, he prioritizes strategic spending: "The best way to save money is to spend it on things that matter." He values business education through conferences and literature over penny-pinching practices.
