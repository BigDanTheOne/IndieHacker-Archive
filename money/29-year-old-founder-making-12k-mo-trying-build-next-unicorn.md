## Founder's Journey and Philosophy

**Previous Experience:**
Shukurov previously created 50 online Photoshop courses generating $2,500-$4,000 monthly. He abandoned this revenue stream recognizing it didn't align with his ambition to build a billion-dollar company impacting Azerbaijan's startup ecosystem.

**Learning Curve:**
An introvert initially terrified of sales, he overcame this limitation through self-education. He emphasizes: "Sales is something you have to overcome" to achieve significant financial success.

He also taught himself coding after a previous venture (restaurant discovery app) failed when his technical cofounder departed, causing all 200 restaurant clients to leave.

**Core Business Beliefs:**
- "VC money is the way to go" when pursuing unicorn status, contrasting with bootstrapping for sustainable lifestyle businesses
- Prefers cofounders with equity stakes over freelancers, citing statistics that 90% of startups fail, with higher failure rates for those outsourcing critical functions
- Advocates full-time team commitment rather than side hustles

## Key Quotes and Insights

**On Sales Mastery:**
"If you want to have a successful business, sales is just one thing you have to get over. You just have to do it."

**On Personal Finance:**
"Saving money is good. But refusing yourself things that would make you really happy is bad. You should find a balance."

**On Investment Strategy:**
"I believe I can earn more by investing in my own business than by investing in the financial market."

**On Sustainable Growth:**
"I believe slow progress is better than quick luck."

## Notable Investment History

Shukurov demonstrated trading acumen investing approximately $100 in Iron Finance (a crypto project), cashing out at $1,000 before the token crashed to $0 the following day. He monitored Polygon community discussions before the exit.

He plans future diversification across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and major IT companies once business growth stabilizes.

## Future Plans

Currently seeking an additional $200,000 in funding to accelerate growth and outpace competitors, prioritizing rapid expansion over cost reduction despite current runway constraints.
