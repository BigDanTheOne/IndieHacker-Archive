## Business Model and Philosophy

The company intentionally operates at a loss while investing heavily in product development and team building. The hybrid approach combines a services business (white-glove client work) with SaaS product development. As Berkay noted, "I value prudence but also believe in bold moves."

The service business funds runway while providing customer insights to refine the SaaS platform, creating a feedback loop for product-market fit.

## Personal Investment Strategy

Berkay maintains a balanced approach: high-risk ventures paired with conservative personal investments including gold holdings and high-yield Turkish savings accounts (40-50% annual interest rates).

Combined personal investments: $100,000-$120,000

**Key advice shared:** "Focus on creating value. If your product genuinely solves problems, financial success follows."
