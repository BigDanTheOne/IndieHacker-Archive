## Key Advice

Diego emphasizes: "Make sure that you can pay yourself before becoming a full-time indie hacker." He plans waiting until achieving $1,000/month revenue before transitioning full-time.

He recommends reading *I Will Teach You to Be Rich* by Ramit Sethi and maintaining disciplined saving habits while enjoying life strategically through travel experiences.
