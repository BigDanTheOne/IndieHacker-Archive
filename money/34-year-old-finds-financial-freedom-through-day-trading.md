## Beginner Investment Guidance

Watson recommends starting with exchange-traded funds like $SPY, $QQQ, $IVV, $VOO, $VTI, and $VUG for new investors. He emphasizes several principles:

- Invest only surplus capital you can afford to lose
- Develop investment rationale beyond social media trends

## Philosophy on Financial Freedom

Watson defines financial independence as living the lifestyle you desire without financial stress. He reflects that money itself doesn't create happiness but eliminates a significant stress source and enables pursuing meaningful activities. He maintains a modest lifestyle and emphasizes that "no matter how much you have" in savings, it rarely feels sufficient.

## Final Takeaway

Watson's closing counsel centers on productivity: "Make your savings work for you... don't let your money sit stagnant. Save consistently, no matter the amount."
