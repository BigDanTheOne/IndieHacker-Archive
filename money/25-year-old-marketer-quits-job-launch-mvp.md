## About Alex Liu

Alex Liu, a 25-year-old founder, left employment in June 2024 to focus entirely on AutoAE, a video editing tool positioned between CapCut and Adobe After Effects. The product launched in July and generated $400 monthly recurring revenue within its first month.

## Financial Snapshot

**Business Metrics:**
- Monthly recurring revenue: $400
- Initial funding: $1,000 personal savings
- Current business account balance: $1,480.27
- Runway remaining: 6 months
- Founder salary: $0 (plans to take 20% when hitting ~$1k MRR)

**Personal Monthly Expenses:**
- Rent: $200
- Food: $250
- SaaS subscriptions: $50
- Vehicle payment: $300

**Business Expenses:** Effectively $0 through strategic use of free tiers and volunteer contributors

## Product and Revenue Model

AutoAE offers three monetization options: free tier, one-time purchase ($2.90 per video), and subscriptions ($8.30/month). Alex acquired initial customers through cold outreach and connections with YouTuber friends.

## Key Philosophy and Lessons

**On Commitment:**
Alex emphasizes that splitting focus between employment and entrepreneurship doesn't work for his productivity style. He needed complete dedication to pursue timing-sensitive marketing opportunities.

**On Financial Discipline:**
The founder calculates ROI for every business decision, even minor SaaS purchases. He budgets rigorously and divides available capital into spending, risk-taking (marketing), and emergency reserves.

**On Equity Structure:**
Despite his co-founder working part-time, they maintain equal 50-50 equity based on equal incentivization rather than hours logged.

**On Runway Management:**
Alex saved six months of personal runway before quitting, allowing sustained focus without immediate income pressure.

## Marketing Approach

His primary advice to other founders emphasizes multi-channel marketing beyond X/Twitter: Reddit, Medium, Indie Hackers, Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. He advocates for being both maker and marketer.

## Financial Perspective

Alex rejects traditional Asian family values emphasizing aggressive savings, instead prioritizing purpose-driven work. He won't pursue external funding until reaching $1k MRR as a product-market fit indicator. He currently avoids stock market investments, viewing time as his most valuable asset at 25, though he plans to diversify after age 28.
