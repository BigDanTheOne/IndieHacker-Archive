Dave Nevogt, co-founder of Hubstaff time tracking software, discusses building a bootstrapped SaaS business alongside Jared Brown. The platform helps remote teams track time and manage distributed workforces across multiple time zones.

## Origin Story

Nevogt sought a time-tracking solution in 2008 but found nothing suitable. This gap led to developing Hubstaff with his specific needs in mind, later allowing customer feedback to guide product development.

## Funding and Development

The founders invested $26,000 each (totaling $52,000) from personal savings generated by previous ventures. They built Hubstaff alongside other businesses over 7-8 months before launching with paid plans in August 2013.

## Growth Strategy

Word-of-mouth and quality content distribution drove most expansion. While early advertising proved unprofitable after transitioning to paid models, offering free trials maintained strong conversion rates of approximately 6%. The founders discovered that "free plans end up losing money and stunting growth" through support burden and user expectations.

## Revenue Trajectory

Launch included 2,000 free members offered 40% lifetime discounts, converting about 275 to paid accounts. Revenue grew steadily through continuous feature releases addressing customer requests.

## Future Vision

The founders maintain lifestyle business principles, rejecting venture funding and massive scaling. They're expanding into Hubstaff Talent, a free freelancer directory addressing client staffing challenges.

## Key Learnings

Understanding customer acquisition sources earlier would have optimized strategy. Building desktop and mobile versions created overhead, though it provided competitive advantages and barriers to entry.

## Advice for Entrepreneurs

Nevogt recommends studying Richard Koch's "The 80/20 Principle" and evaluating risk-reward scenarios. He advocates choosing web-only projects to simplify focus and hiring, warning that multi-platform development diverts resources significantly.
