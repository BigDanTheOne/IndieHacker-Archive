This case study features Andrew Kamphey, founder of Better Sheets, a Google Sheets-focused business generating approximately $5,000 monthly in revenue.

## Background and Journey

Kamphey spent five years automating tasks using Google Apps Script before launching his first venture in 2018. He initially sold an influencer marketing site and newsletter for $37,000, though it had only generated $12,000 in annual revenue. His subsequent SaaS venture, Hypeletter, stalled at $200 monthly revenue.

His cofounder recognized the value in Kamphey's spreadsheet expertise -- something he initially dismissed as "a fluke." This validation proved pivotal.

## The $5K Launch

In 2020, Kamphey built Better Sheets in 24 hours using Loom for recording, Gumroad for payments, and Carrd for landing pages. He created eight unedited tutorial videos, offering four free and four behind a paywall. The product launched at $390 monthly revenue and accelerated significantly through AppSumo.

## Revenue Diversification

Current revenue streams include:

- Lifetime deals via AppSumo: 50%
- Subscriptions/consulting: 22%
- Templates and tools: 12%
- Udemy courses: 10%
- AppSumo Marketplace: 4%
- YouTube ad revenue: 2%

## Key Strategies

Kamphey emphasized marketplace growth as the primary driver, noting AppSumo's concentrated buyer base matched his target audience perfectly. He deliberately avoided aggressive SEO despite recognizing missed opportunities, citing delayed feedback loops as demotivating.

His validation came from a single customer who purchased immediately after launch, proving concept viability through actual usage and enthusiastic feedback.

## Philosophy

Kamphey prioritizes lifestyle optimization over maximum profitability, focusing on maintaining independence while supporting his family's Southeast Asia travels. However, he recently recognized the need to boost consulting services to fund upcoming education expenses.

## Advice

His core recommendation: "Just ask." He credits indie hacker communities and local meetups as invaluable, noting that one attendee at his organized meetup became a future SaaS cofounder.
