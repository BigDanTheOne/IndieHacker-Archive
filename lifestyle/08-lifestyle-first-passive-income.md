After a decade running a micro SaaS as a solo non-technical founder, Troy Christmas expanded on building passive income aligned with personal lifestyle goals.

## Self-Awareness and Goals

Christmas left corporate law to pursue meaningful education work while maintaining entrepreneurial interests. His objectives were clear: work independently, maintain his existing career for stability, diversify income without multiplying problems, and achieve "periodically passive" revenue -- largely automated but requiring occasional activity bursts.

## Strategic Elimination

He deliberately rejected numerous business paths: writing books without platforms, mission-critical B2B solutions, non-scalable consulting models, and ventures competing against established players. His 2012 idea stood apart -- it solved his own problem, addressed genuine customer frustration, wasn't mission-critical, faced no competition, and remained small enough to code solo.

## Business Optimization

His key decisions prioritized lifestyle compatibility:

- Eliminated free versions (customer service burden exceeded marketing value)
- Maintained low prices to discourage competition while raising rates strategically
- Offered annual subscriptions only (monthly management seemed burdensome)
- Avoided handling sensitive payment data
- Treated customers exceptionally
- Automated systems extensively

## Results Achieved

The business required roughly 2-3 weekly hours after initial setup, allowed vacation and life flexibility, created professional backup through paid support contractors, and enabled parallel ventures without jeopardy.
