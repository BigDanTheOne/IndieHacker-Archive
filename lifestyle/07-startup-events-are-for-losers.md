Have you ever been to one of these startup events? If it disappointed you, you aren't alone.

Back in 2014, when Peter Thiel dropped by one of these gatherings, someone asked, "Could the next Zuckerberg be in this room?" Thiel famously replied, "He would never show up to an event like this."

Serial founder Pieter Levels recently ranted about this on X, claiming that startup events attract people who've never actually built anything. Because these events are often free or easily accessible, anyone can attend -- including those with no startup experience.

As early-stage investor Khushi noted on X, many attendees are either engineers at legacy companies wanting to network or VCs trying to gather information, rather than actual builders working on products.

## The Problem with Event Culture

Levels argues that startup events create a problematic environment. He suggests attendees are often "ecosystem leeches" who talk about startups rather than building them. This tendency toward excessive discussion rather than action can be contagious, pulling genuine builders into unproductive conversations.

The core issue: most attendees lack real startup experience and are primarily focused on networking rather than creating value.

## Building in Public as an Alternative

Rather than attending events, Levels recommends leveraging social media platforms like X, Indie Hackers, TikTok, and LinkedIn. Building in public -- sharing your progress, challenges, and updates online -- exposes your work to vastly larger audiences than any physical event could reach.

According to Levels, this approach naturally attracts quality connections. Successful builders recognize shared struggles and connect based on demonstrated effort and actual progress, regardless of current revenue levels.

## Quality Matters

The article acknowledges that some startup events have merit -- specifically those with filters such as ticket prices, invite-only access, or focused themes. These barriers to entry tend to attract more serious participants and generate higher-quality conversations.

However, the general sentiment presented is clear: productive builders gain more value from shipping features and engaging online than attending typical startup gatherings.
