The "build in public" movement inspired thousands of founders to share their journeys transparently. Buffer and Ghost pioneered this approach, turning customers into devoted fans through radical openness about metrics, revenue, and growth strategies.

However, a significant shift is occurring. Successful indie hackers are increasingly going dark -- deleting revenue updates, scrubbing product URLs from bios, and entering stealth mode to protect their businesses from copycats.

## Why the Shift?

### The Copycat Problem

Once a business reaches visible traction, it becomes a target. Low-barrier-entry products are especially vulnerable. Copycats see proven revenue models and quickly launch imitations, though most fail to sustain their efforts. The frustration isn't necessarily lost revenue but rather the stress and distraction these clones create.

### Mental Health and Safety Concerns

Public revenue figures amplify stress. Seeing numbers live invites constant scrutiny. Additionally, some founders have cited security and safety concerns, particularly in regions where visible wealth becomes a target.

## The New Playbook: Three-Phase Strategy

### Phase 1: Build in Public (0-$10K MRR)

Share progress freely to attract early users, build community, and demonstrate accountability.

### Phase 2: Go Ghost Mode ($10K+ MRR)

Delete revenue stats but continue sharing non-metric wins -- customer stories and product lessons -- while protecting your competitive advantages.

### Phase 3: Selective Transparency ($30K+ MRR)

Share milestones sparingly, such as annual recaps.

## Copycats Usually Fail

Most imitators lack the execution depth, branding sophistication, and customer relationships that create genuine competitive moats. They bypass the learning process and launch half-baked versions, rarely outshining originals.

## The Bottom Line

Building in public remains valuable for early-stage visibility and community support. However, once genuine traction emerges, strategic silence protects your business without abandoning transparency entirely. The evolution isn't abandonment -- it's maturation.
