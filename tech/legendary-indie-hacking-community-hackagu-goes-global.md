Hackagu, a Bali-based indie hacking community founded by Cso Horvath in 2019, has launched a global expansion blueprint. The community operates through weekly Thursday meetups at co-working spaces where members collaborate, receive feedback, and demonstrate completed work for accountability.

Notable alumni include Danny Postma, Jon Yongfook, and Tony Dinh, who called the group "legendary." The organization has published an expansion framework via GitHub, establishing hacka.network as a directory for new chapters worldwide.

Existing chapters include Hackumvit in Bangkok (operating since 2022), Hackaditch in London (launched summer 2024), and emerging groups in Singapore (Hackapura), Turkey (Hackatalya), and Copenhagen (Hackahagen).

James Potter, Hackagu admin and founder of Rephonic and Reletter, explained the model's appeal: members missed "the weekly ritual" after relocating globally. The framework emphasizes decentralized operations with minimal central coordination.

Success metrics include Chidi Williams's Y Combinator Fall 2024 acceptance for fintech product Rulebase, and multiple App Store launches by members.

Cso emphasized his philosophy: "I'm a huge fan of remix culture. I always try to encourage everyone with any ideas for Hackagu to pick them up and run with them."

## Key Lessons

- Community-driven accountability mechanisms (weekly demos) strengthen engagement
- Decentralized networks scale better than centralized hierarchies
- Non-transactional, friendly environments attract serious builders
