Trump's executive order changed the crypto game, letting startups pivot to tokenized equity from trading paper stocks.

The article discusses how President Trump's January 24, 2025 executive order creates a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrency. Key changes include protecting crypto companies' banking access, banning U.S. central bank digital currencies, and establishing a federal task force for crypto regulations.

The piece explains that cryptoequity represents ownership through digital tokens held in crypto wallets rather than traditional paper certificates. These tokens are programmable and handle dividends, voting rights, and vesting automatically through smart contracts.

## Pros

- Global investor reach beyond traditional venture capital circles
- Automation of compliance functions through code execution
- Community building opportunities by distributing tokens to loyal users

## Cons

- Regulatory uncertainty pending 2025 SEC/CFTC clarifications
- Price volatility affecting startup finances
- Security risks from platform vulnerabilities

The article references Siqi Chen's MIRA token fundraising effort, noting how crypto's 24/7 global markets demonstrate liquidity potential for equity applications.

## Key Lessons

- Tokenized equity offers faster, more flexible funding mechanisms than traditional approaches
- Smart contracts can enforce compliance better than legal documentation alone
- Regulatory clarity remains essential before mainstream adoption occurs

## Tech Stack Mentioned

- Blockchain/tokens
- Smart contracts
- Stablecoins
- Solana blockchain (referenced via MIRA token example)
