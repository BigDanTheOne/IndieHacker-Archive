This article showcases four successful applications developed through "vibe coding"--building apps primarily through AI prompts rather than traditional manual coding, directly countering skepticism about AI-assisted development's viability.

**ChatIQ (Customer Support Bot):** Created by Sebastian Volkis (non-technical, self-taught). Revenue of $2,000 MRR ($24,000 ARR). Built with 80% AI-generated code, starting on Bubble.io and migrating to Next.js, AWS Lambda, Claude Opus, and GPT-4. Launched in 2023 and reached $3K MRR within 30 days.

**Fly (Flight Simulator):** Created by Pieter Levels with no game development experience. Revenue of $12,000 MRR ($144,000 ARR). Built with 90% AI-generated code using vanilla JavaScript, Three.js, WebSockets, GPT-4, and Cursor AI. Prototype completed in 3 hours. Launched February 2025 and went viral after Elon Musk endorsement.

**TrendFeed (Content Discovery):** Created by Sebastian Volkis. Revenue of $10,000 MRR ($120,000 ARR). Built with 75% AI-generated code using Next.js, Node.js, GPT-4, Claude, and Replit. 4-day prototype creation. Launched February 2025 with $12K in the first month.

**Vibe Sail (Sailing Simulator):** Created by Nicola Manzini (JavaScript experience). Revenue of $8,000 MRR ($96,000 ARR). Built with 85% AI-generated code using Three.js, WebSockets, GPT-4, and GitHub Copilot. Started February 26, 2025 and monetized by April 2025.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- ChatIQ: $2,000 MRR ($24,000 ARR)
- Fly: $12,000 MRR ($144,000 ARR)
- TrendFeed: $10,000 MRR ($120,000 ARR)
- Vibe Sail: $8,000 MRR ($96,000 ARR)
- Combined: $32,000 MRR ($384,000 ARR)

**Key Lessons:**
- Vibe-coded applications can achieve meaningful commercial success
- Founders without traditional backgrounds can launch revenue-generating products
- AI handles approximately 75-90% of code generation in these examples
- Rapid prototyping (3 hours to 4 days) validates ideas quickly
- Non-technical founders can build viable products with AI assistance

**Tech Stack:**
Next.js, AWS Lambda, Claude Opus, GPT-4, Bubble.io, vanilla JavaScript, Three.js, WebSockets, Cursor AI, Node.js, Replit, GitHub Copilot
