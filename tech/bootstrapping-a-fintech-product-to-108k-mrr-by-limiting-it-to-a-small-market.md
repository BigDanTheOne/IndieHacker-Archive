Sumit Kumar founded Parqet, a fintech portfolio tracking product, and grew it to EUR 100k MRR (approximately $108k USD) by deliberately limiting the product to German-speaking markets (DACH region).

## Revenue Numbers

- Current MRR: EUR 100k (~$108k USD)
- Starting investment: ~$100/month for first five months
- Revenue at full-time transition: EUR 20k MRR with thousands of customers

## Key Lessons

1. **Focus on niche markets:** "We need to build for a niche first and can expand later." Parqet deliberately limited itself to DACH to dominate locally.
2. **Marketing trumps features:** "Marketing and sales are underrated...Marketing is how you grow -- not features."
3. **Bootstrap for longevity:** Staying independent provided strategic advantages when VC funding dried up in 2022.
4. **Product-led growth:** Allowing users to share portfolios publicly created organic viral loops.
5. **Audience size is irrelevant:** Early success didn't require existing followers.
6. **Long-term channels over paid ads:** SEO, YouTube, and email lists provided sustainable acquisition.
