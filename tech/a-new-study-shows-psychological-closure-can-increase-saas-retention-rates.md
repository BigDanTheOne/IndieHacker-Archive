A Harvard Business Review study examined how people value completion. Researchers surveyed approximately 2,000 U.S. participants about choosing between higher immediate payments or lower delayed payments.

Key finding: "Almost 86% of participants preferred to pay more upfront for at least one option."

The article explains that unresolved goals create psychological burden, and people prioritize mental relief over financial optimization. Those nearing task completion experience increased impatience.

## Key Lessons

1. **Mental Relief Priority:** Users value completing goals more than saving money
2. **Leverage Proximity:** Frame products as solutions for nearly-finished objectives
3. **Reframe Progress:** Highlight incomplete actions as "almost complete" to motivate onboarding
4. **Practical Applications:** Examples provided for project management, email marketing, and CRM platforms

## Implementation Examples

- Project Management: "You're just two steps away from finishing"
- Email Marketing: "Your campaign is almost ready to launch"
- CRM: "One step away from closing the deal"
