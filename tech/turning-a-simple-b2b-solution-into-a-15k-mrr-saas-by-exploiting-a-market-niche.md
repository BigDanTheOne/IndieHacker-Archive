Lukas Hermann founded Stagetimer, a timer tool for live event productions, growing it to $15k MRR by focusing on a niche market.

## Revenue Numbers

- Primary Product (Stagetimer): $15,000 MRR stated; ~$20,000/month actual (subscriptions + one-time payments)
- Secondary Product (Rundown Studio): $4,000 MRR
- User Base: 13,000+ accounts

## Key Lessons

1. **Start Simple:** Hermann deliberately chose the simplest idea from a long list, knowing his first venture would likely fail.
2. **SEO Dominance:** Search engine optimization drives at least 40% of Stagetimer's growth through low-volume, high-intent keywords.
3. **Customer-Driven Evolution:** Engaging with Reddit communities and live events revealed how the timer could serve larger production teams.
4. **Flexible Revenue Models:** Introducing one-time payments alongside subscriptions increased actual revenue approximately 50% above stated MRR.
5. **B2B Complexity Increases:** B2B products become increasingly complex over time -- integrations with hardware require ongoing investment.
6. **Community Over Isolation:** Finding teammates through Discord servers and local connections combats entrepreneurial loneliness.

**Tech Stack:** Node.js, Vue.js, JavaScript
