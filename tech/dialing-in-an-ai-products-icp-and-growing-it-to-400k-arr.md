Snow Lee, a 3x founder, built Runbear after experiencing severe cognitive overload managing seven teams simultaneously at his previous company. He created a platform enabling non-technical teams to build AI agents without coding expertise.

**The ICP Challenge & Pivot:**
Initially targeting DevOps engineers, Snow discovered engineers preferred building their own agents rather than using pre-built solutions. The breakthrough came when observing that non-technical roles—account managers, customer success teams, operations leaders—derived genuine value. These communication-heavy positions benefited most from automated task handling.

**Finding the ICP:**
Snow analyzed existing use cases to identify consistent value delivery, conducted in-depth customer interviews examining workflows and pain points, then mapped industry opportunities against criteria (urgency, frequency, popularity, expense). This framework narrowed focus to communication-intensive teams.

**Revenue Expansion:**
Until July, Runbear operated a single subscription plan with agent creation limits. Power users requested restriction removal. Rather than simply unlocking features, the team introduced a business plan tier, validating stronger pricing acceptance. Over 20 higher-paying customers adopted the plan with zero churn.

**Core Philosophy:**
The "AI as teammate" approach differs from rule-based workflows. Agents observe message intent, decide when intervention helps, execute tasks, and improve through conversation. The system learns from user guidance—when asked to perform unfamiliar tasks, it requests instructions, then remembers them.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Current: $33,000 monthly ($396,000 ARR)
- Target: $2,000,000 ARR
- Previous company (Buzzvil): $80,000,000 annual revenue

**Key Lessons:**
- ICP clarity precedes scaling: Broad targeting wastes resources
- Observe actual usage over assumptions: Engineers wanting to build revealed the true opportunity in non-technical roles
- Start with killer use case: Solve repetitive question-answering first, build trust before expanding
- Stay in motion: Market dynamics shift constantly; adjust rapidly
- Pricing follows value discovery: Let customer behavior signal willingness-to-pay

**Tech Stack:**
TypeScript, Vercel, Supabase, Claude AI, OpenAI, Gemini, Perplexity
