## Revenue Numbers

- $24,381.04 (final sale price for Optic)
- $15,000 (initial listing price)
- $25,000 (Dutch auction starting price)
- $46,000 (five projects sold in 2024)
- $70,000 (total including Optic)

## Full Article

Josh Pigford launched Optic (competitive monitoring app) on January 13 following a Twitter poll. Despite shipping six major features in two weeks and personally emailing fifty users, growth remained minimal. By February 1, recognizing insufficient revenue, he pivoted to a Dutch auction format, ultimately selling for $24,381.04 within 24 hours to 278 interested observers.

## Key Lessons

1. Speed matters: Built and launched within 7 days
2. Audience is valuable: Large following enabled quick sale
3. Pivot when needed: Shifted from growth strategy to exit when traction stalled
4. Dutch auction mechanism works: Created urgency with descending-price model
5. Market exists for "starter projects": Buyers seek turnkey SaaS with existing infrastructure
6. Build in public: Transparency and consistent updates drove community interest
7. Know when to exit: Recognized low revenue potential and capitalized on buyer interest
