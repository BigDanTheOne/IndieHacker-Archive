All paid OpenAI API users can now access preview and mini versions of the o1 large language model. OpenAI enabled streaming for these models, allowing incremental response generation.

The o1-preview model performs above PhD-level in scientific areas and excels at coding and math compared to predecessors, though it responds slower than GPT-4o. The mini version offers faster responses with more limitations.

Previously, only "tier five" developers (those spending $1,000+ on OpenAI) accessed the model via API. It has been available to paid ChatGPT users for weeks but cannot search the internet through that interface.

**Capabilities:** OpenAI trained o1 to reason step-by-step through problems. The o1-preview correctly answered 83% of International Mathematics Olympiad questions versus GPT-4o's 13%. It outperforms human PhD-level benchmarks in biology, physics, chemistry, and coding.

**Pricing:**
- o1-preview: $15 per million input tokens, $60 per million output tokens
- o1-mini: $3 per million input tokens, $12 per million output tokens
- GPT-4o: $2.50 per million input tokens, $10 per million output tokens

**Key Lessons:** Advanced reasoning requires accuracy-over-speed tradeoffs; specialized models serve niche use cases; cost-benefit analysis essential for production adoption
