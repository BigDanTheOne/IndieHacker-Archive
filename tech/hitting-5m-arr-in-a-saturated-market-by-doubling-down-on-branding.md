Blaze is an AI-powered virtual marketer assisting small businesses through the complete content lifecycle: brainstorming, creation, editing, publishing, and performance analysis. Adam Nathan founded it after three years building Almanac, a wiki collaboration tool for remote teams.

Nathan's motivation stems from observing his parents' struggle as independent retailers transitioning to e-commerce. He believed small business owners represented "some of the hardest workers in America" yet remained underserved by modern growth tools.

The branding approach involved extracting deeper meaning (supporting underserved entrepreneurs), translating to core values (speed, memorable storytelling), and visualizing these through retro superhero aesthetics injected consistently across website, communications, and onboarding.

Growth combined influencer marketing on TikTok with customer-led strategies. The team contacted creators directly via DM with minimal prescriptive guidance, allowing authentic content creation. Early campaigns generated substantial reach before scaling successful videos into paid advertising.

## Key Lessons

1. **Identify Underserved Markets:** Small business owners and solopreneurs were overlooked by AI content tools despite needing them "ten times more" than enterprise marketers.
2. **Brand as Growth Lever:** "A brand is the ultimate growth lever" through emotional connection rather than just functional value.
3. **Visual Identity Matters:** Incorporated 1950s-60s superhero pop culture aesthetics to differentiate from "cold, colorless, personality-free" tech branding.
4. **Influencer Strategy:** Paid creators $300+ per TikTok video initially, achieved 20M impressions, then scaled winners into ads.
5. **Customer-Led Growth:** Build engagement ladders progressing from webinars to reviews to referrals.
6. **Company Culture:** Intentional culture valuing learning from failures sustains teams through difficult pivots.
7. **Strategic Timing:** Develop discernment between technology bubbles and genuine shifts like AI adoption.
