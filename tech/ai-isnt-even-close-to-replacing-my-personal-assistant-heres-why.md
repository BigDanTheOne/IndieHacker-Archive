A startup founder discusses why he maintains a $1,000/month remote personal assistant despite extensive AI adoption across his business and personal life.

The author describes himself as an early AI adopter who uses ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode for approximately an hour daily, employs speech-to-text tools like Superwhisper, and subscribes to OpenAI's Pro service. Despite this technological engagement, he retains human administrative support.

## General Tasks His Assistant Handles

- Travel planning (flights, accommodations)
- Proactive task identification from project backlogs
- Pharmacy communications
- Book archiving in project management systems
- Administrative deadline reminders

## Email Management

The author emphasizes inbox zero maintenance as the most valuable service, suggesting he would retain the assistant for half her current cost based solely on this function. Tasks include labeling, archiving, selective replies, and calendar coordination.

## Editorial Calendar Management

His assistant manages publishing workflows for 5-10 weekly articles, including content scheduling, journalist coordination, image creation, and social media account management.

## Forum Curation

Responsibilities include title editing, low-value post identification, and bot account detection and management.

## Sales Support

Pre-sale activities involve client guidance and package upselling; post-sale work includes ad copy refinement, email preview creation, and vendor coordination.

## Assistant Details

- Based in the Philippines, works 9 AM-5 PM EST
- Proficient in Photoshop and Figma
- Uses internally developed AI writing tools
- Previous tech executive experience

## Revenue Numbers Mentioned

- Assistant salary: $1,000/month
- OpenAI Pro subscription: $200/month

## Key Lessons

1. **Context and judgment matter more than raw capability.** AI excels at execution but struggles with nuanced decision-making requiring understanding of priorities and tradeoffs.

2. **Human assistants provide proactive thinking.** Unlike reactive AI systems, skilled assistants anticipate needs and independently identify workflow improvements.

3. **The gap closes through hybrid approaches, not replacement.** Effective workflows combine AI for repetitive tasks with human judgment for complex situations.

4. **Feedback loops and adaptability distinguish human performance.** Assistants improve workflows continuously through experience; AI systems typically repeat mistakes without correction mechanisms.

5. **Soft skills remain irreplaceable.** Travel coordination, relationship management, and stakeholder communication require contextual understanding AI cannot fully replicate.
