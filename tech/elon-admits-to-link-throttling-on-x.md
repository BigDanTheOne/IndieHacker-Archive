Elon Musk acknowledged X's practice of deprioritizing links in response to Paul Graham's complaint. When Graham objected to this throttling, Musk suggested users "write a description in the main post and put the link in the reply" to prevent "lazy linking."

Graham countered this logic in his response, questioning why sharing an essay link directly constitutes laziness while sharing the same content through a two-step process somehow improves the platform experience. A commenter, Channing Allen, noted the underlying motivation: X reduces engagement when users navigate away from the platform.

**Key Lessons:**
- X deliberately deprioritizes external links to retain user attention and ad engagement
- Platform policies can incentivize deceptive workarounds rather than addressing root concerns
- Business incentives often conflict with user experience and content distribution
