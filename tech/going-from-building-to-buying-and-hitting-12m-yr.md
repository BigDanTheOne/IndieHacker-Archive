Dom Wells transitioned from building affiliate websites and agencies to acquiring profitable online businesses through his holding company, Onfolio Holdings, Inc. The publicly traded company specializes in acquiring small B2B agencies, info products, e-commerce, and marketplace businesses.

Wells started by building affiliate websites while living overseas. After generating roughly $10k monthly from affiliate sites and agencies, he discovered that acquiring existing websites offered superior returns compared to building from scratch. He began acquiring smaller businesses via Empire Flippers, then raised capital to scale the acquisition strategy systematically.

Wells describes pursuing "1+1=3 acquisitions"--deals where synergies create immediate value. His central leadership team provides strategic support while individual portfolio companies maintain operational autonomy. Rather than acquiring random profitable businesses, he focuses on opportunities where existing expertise creates competitive advantages and value multiplication.

The company went public at $1.2M annual revenue. Being publicly traded provides advisor access and credibility but introduces scrutiny and expenses. Wells suggests raising more capital at IPO or waiting for greater profitability.

Individual portfolio companies employ paid traffic, referral programs, and SEO strategies tailored to their specific markets. Wells targets acquisition multiples of 3-4x net income for businesses in the $1-5 million revenue range.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $12 million annual revenue run rate
- $1 million monthly revenue
- ~20 portfolio companies
- ~$10 million total acquisition spending to date
- Revenue at IPO: $1.2 million
- Target acquisition multiples: 3-4x net income
- Next goal: $100 million in revenue

**Key Lessons:**
- Buying can beat building: acquiring existing businesses offered superior returns to building from scratch
- Focus on synergistic acquisitions: "1+1=3" deals where existing expertise creates value multiplication
- "The reason you have so many ideas is that you're hungry for success. That's a good thing. But channel it toward one or two things."
- IPO trade-offs: public company status brings credibility but also scrutiny and expense
- Growth tactics vary: each portfolio company needs strategies tailored to its specific market
