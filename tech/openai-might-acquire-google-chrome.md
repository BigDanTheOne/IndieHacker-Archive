OpenAI's head of product for ChatGPT, Nick Turley, testified in court that the company would be interested in purchasing Chrome if Google is forced to divest it due to antitrust rulings.

Google was recently ruled a search monopolist, and the US Department of Justice proposed penalties including forcing Google to divest Chrome. Bloomberg reported Turley's court testimony.

Chrome commands a 67% market share with approximately 4 billion users worldwide. Turley stated OpenAI would "have the ability to introduce users into what an AI-first experience looks like" through the browser. Chrome's usage patterns could also train advanced AI models, particularly those designed for browser automation agents.

Google claims Chrome cannot operate independently, though critics cite the company's multibillion-dollar search-based advertising business as proof otherwise.

The article advises founders to optimize for AI through GEO (generative engine optimization) over traditional SEO, and to reduce platform risk by building direct audience relationships through email, communities, and owned channels rather than relying on browser-based discovery.

**Key Lessons:**
- Chrome's 67% market share with ~4 billion users represents massive AI integration opportunity
- Optimize for GEO (generative engine optimization) over traditional SEO
- Reduce platform risk by building direct audience relationships through owned channels
- Browser usage patterns could train advanced AI models for automation agents
