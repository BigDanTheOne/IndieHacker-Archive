The piece features an interview with Rachel Plotnick, an associate professor of cinema and media studies at Indiana University and author of *Power Button: A History of Pleasure, Panic, and the Politics of Pushing* (2018).

Around 2009, Plotnick noticed discourse predicting buttons would disappear as touchscreens became prevalent. However, buttons remained ubiquitous across devices -- from elevators to coffee makers. Her research revealed persistent anxieties about control and who gets access to push buttons have existed for over a century.

Regarding the current "re-buttonization" trend, Plotnick attributes it to touchscreen fatigue. She notes: "people seem to have a hunger for physical buttons, both because you don't always have to look at them." She identifies benefits including tactile feedback, reduced visual demand while driving, and accessibility for visually impaired users who struggled with touchscreen-dependent interfaces.

The interview covers why companies are consulting her expertise -- particularly regarding medical device design, defibrillator adoption barriers, and understanding historical button interface lessons before implementing new technologies.

**Key Lessons:**
- Multiple interface modalities work better than single-option designs
- Historical patterns inform contemporary technology decisions
- Accessibility considerations benefit all users, not just those with disabilities

**Tech Stack Mentioned:**
- iPhone 16
- Microsoft Kinect
- Voice assistants (Alexa, Siri)
