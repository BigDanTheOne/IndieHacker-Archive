Ernst Mulders, 33, has built side projects since age 16. AirAssist, created four years ago as a React Native learning exercise, became his most successful venture -- and it's saving lives.

Initially, Mulders built the app to track emergency helicopters in the Netherlands using public ambulance network data, displaying 4-5 aircraft locations. Users requested improvements, leading him to expand tracking to over 550 aircraft internationally with notification features and country-specific customizations.

Monetization began with a EUR 2.99 ad-removal fee, surprising Mulders when users immediately purchased. He later introduced subscriptions at roughly EUR 1/month, EUR 10/year, and EUR 20 lifetime -- subsequently doubling prices. Growth came primarily through App Store optimization.

WaterBomber followed the same model for firefighting assets, covering Europe, Australia, and North America.

Police officers reported the app saved minutes during emergencies, helping save lives. Fire departments across Italy, Australia, and the U.S. use it daily.

## Revenue Numbers

- Between $2K and $4K per month

## Key Lessons

- "Don't over-engineer and don't wait too long to launch"
- Listen to user feedback -- they perceive functionality differently than creators
- Monetization and marketing are essential alongside product development
- Unexpected products often succeed most

**Tech Stack:** React Native (frontend), PHP (backend), Node.js (microservices)
