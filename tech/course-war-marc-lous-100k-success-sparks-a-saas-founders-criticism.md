Marc Lou released CodeFa.st, a coding course with the tagline "Build your SaaS in 14 days," generating $100K in revenue within two days. Arib Khan, a 19-year-old founder, criticized Marc for selling courses without sufficient expertise, noting that Marc's most successful SaaS product (Datafa.st) generates only $1K monthly revenue. Arib compared course selling to "the male version of onlyfans" and argued boilerplates are merely repackaged courses.

However, Marc has supporters. Developers note he's shipped 25+ projects in three years, demonstrating consistent execution ability. Some observers suggest Arib engages in "engagement farming," using Marc's larger platform for visibility. The controversy has attracted comments from figures like Daniel Vassallo and Brett from Designjoy, who defend Marc's approach.

**Revenue Numbers Mentioned:**
- Marc Lou's CodeFa.st: $100,000 in two days
- Marc Lou's Datafa.st: $1,000 monthly recurring revenue
- Arib Khan's Musicfy AI: $100,000 monthly recurring revenue (claimed)
- Arib Khan's Crayo AI: $500,000 monthly recurring revenue (claimed)
- Danny Postma's SEO course: $106,000 within 24 hours

**Key Lessons:**
1. Successfully marketing a product matters more than product superiority
2. Building in public and shipping frequently establishes credibility
3. Course selling ethics depend on creator expertise level
4. Social media drama amplifies business visibility
