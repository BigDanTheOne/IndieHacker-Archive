Dominic Zijlstra, founder of Adaptify, transformed initial AI skepticism into a thriving SaaS company. His background spans engineering physics, space industry work at Airbus, fintech analysis, and previous SaaS experience with Traverse (a language learning platform).

Zijlstra experienced "AI FOMO" in early 2023 after experimenting with ChatGPT. Rather than feeling entirely late, he recognized that prominent voices on social media represented the leading 1% of tech adoption. He and a cofounder began exploring AI product possibilities through newsletters, prompt databases, and client chatbots--generating revenue from these experiments.

The breakthrough occurred when scratching his own SEO itch for Traverse. Initial automation focused on content creation, but adding PR backlink features created differentiation from competitors. The most crucial pivot targeted agencies specifically after noticing demand for multi-site management plans, dramatically improving lifetime value through accumulated client sites.

The team built RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems before the technology had widespread naming. The cofounder learned coding from scratch while Zijlstra became proficient in async Python, LLM chains, and vector databases. Falling AI costs enabled increasingly sophisticated capabilities while maintaining healthy margins.

Zijlstra validated with paid ads, spending approximately $1,000 to acquire the first customer on a $499/month plan, establishing a 2-month payback period that signaled strong product-market fit. His three-tier paid ad funnel includes awareness of pain points at the top, solution positioning vs. alternatives in the middle, and conversion incentives at the bottom.

The entry-level "Pitch Mode" tool solves immediate customer pain points affordably, with a natural upgrade path to the core product. Agencies gradually expand by adding more client sites, increasing LTV substantially.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $167K monthly revenue ($2M ARR)
- $0 to $2M ARR in less than 2 years
- $200K ARR reached within 6 months of pivoting to automated SEO
- ~2 month CAC payback on initial $499/month plan

**Key Lessons:**
- "Whenever you think you're late to a trend, you're still very early"
- Validate with paid ads: spend ~$1,000 to test before heavy building
- Value ladder strategy: entry-level tool with natural upgrade path
- "If you want to go far, go together" -- cofounder partnerships provide invaluable perspective
- Automate ruthlessly: extend AI automation beyond customer products into internal operations
- Critical skill: distinguishing which customer feedback merits building versus ignoring

**Tech Stack:**
NextJS, Tailwind CSS, Vercel (frontend), FastAPI on Google Cloud Run with Cloud Jobs (backend), Firebase, Pinecone (vector database), LangChain, Langsmith, Cursor, Claude Code
