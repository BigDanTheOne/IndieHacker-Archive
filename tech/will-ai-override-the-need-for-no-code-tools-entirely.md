The article discusses whether AI will eliminate the need for no-code tools. Peterson recounts a conversation with an Airtable consulting shop owner who expressed skepticism about AI's near-term enterprise impact, noting that "the distance between sexy AI demo and AI-powered production workflow is still quite far."

Peterson identifies a fundamental constraint: most people lack intrinsic motivation to build software, even when tools become simpler. He references his Airtable experience, explaining that "the limiting function for no code has never been the technology itself, but something much more fundamental: human desire." The bottleneck wasn't complexity -- it was builder interest.

He draws parallels to MOOCs, which promised educational revolution but failed due to poor completion rates. The barrier wasn't access but motivation.

However, Peterson reconsiders using the smartphone camera as a framework. While cameras didn't create millions of filmmakers, they enabled unprecedented visual creativity through platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok.

He concludes that AI likely won't create millions of traditional software developers, but predicts emergence of "a platform that leverages the ease of code generation" for ubiquitous software creation -- similar to how smartphones democratized visual content.

**Key Lessons:**
- Technology accessibility doesn't guarantee adoption
- Human motivation remains the limiting factor
- Transformative platforms emerge through novel use cases, not direct replication
