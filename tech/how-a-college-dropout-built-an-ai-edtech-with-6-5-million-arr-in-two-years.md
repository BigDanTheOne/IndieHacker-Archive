David Park, age 27, transformed his AI writing assistant Jenni AI into a $30 million startup after four failed ventures and a cancer diagnosis. The initial MVP utilized GPT-2 to accelerate writing speed by 10-20%. After GPT-3's release, the founders pivoted from an agency model to SaaS, targeting academics and researchers.

The product gained traction after a viral X thread by Zain Kahn, achieving 10 new users per second. This breakthrough catalyzed consistent 15-20% monthly growth.

- Annual recurring revenue: $6.4 million
- Monthly EBITDA: $150,000
- Growth rate: 27,000% over two years

## Key Lessons

1. "You can always fail. You can fail at something you don't love, so you might as well fail at doing what you love."
2. "Prioritize talking to users more than anything else...Ask them about their pain points."
3. "A small tool that is specialized is often more valuable than a larger tool that's broad."
4. Effective marketing: "A young marketer with TikTok brain rot who has a great work ethic will often outperform the 'established' digital marketing agency."
5. The "POV: You have an essay due" series generated 300+ million views and $500,000+ in revenue.
