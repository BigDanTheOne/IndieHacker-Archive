Thomas Sanlis quit his job three months after graduating to pursue freelancing and indie projects. He spent six years building side projects before reaching $10,000 monthly revenue in January 2025 with his primary product, Uneed—a launch platform and community for builders combining elements of Product Hunt and social media.

Sanlis initially created Uneed while learning NuxtJS, treating it as a coding playground rather than a business venture. The platform evolved organically over years, gaining SEO authority and community recognition before he monetized it seriously.

**Key Career Progression:**
Sanlis emphasized that success requires patience rather than overnight growth. He advises against quitting employment without substantial savings, noting that sustainable indie businesses typically require years to develop, not months.

His biggest challenge wasn't technical or product-related but personal—managing motivation, avoiding burnout, and maintaining work-life balance while working independently. He experienced periods of 10-hour workdays alternating with complete inability to work.

**Work-Life Balance Strategy:**
Sanlis credits two practices with maintaining sustainability: regular cycling (which he describes as nearly non-negotiable) and always accepting social invitations from friends rather than declining for work.

**Revenue Model Diversification:**
Uneed generates income through multiple channels:
- Paid launches ($30 for specific dates, $4.99 for waiting list)
- Directory submissions to 100+ platforms
- Premium featured placements
- Sidebar advertising
- Newsletter sponsorships (11,000 subscribers)
- Product review services (both public and private)

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $10,000 per month (reached July 2025, maintained through November)
- $30 cost for paid launches on specific dates
- $4.99 for waiting list access

**Key Lessons:**
- "There's no magic growth hack; it's been mostly about showing up every day."
- Building sustainable businesses requires years, not months
- Creating scarcity through launch queues increases perceived value
- Self-care directly impacts work capacity; overwork creates diminishing returns
- Starting projects without monetization pressure allows natural SEO and brand growth
- Diversification reduces vulnerability from single revenue streams
