The article explores whether AI can improve security or poses liability risks for indie hackers' SaaS products. It references Marc Louvion's ShipFast security incident, which prompted discussion about vulnerable code in bootstrapped startups.

The piece features insights from Necmettin "Neco" Karakaya, a software developer who launched defendsaas.com after noticing surge in security interest among indie hackers. Karakaya notes that "Security is complex. It often requires understanding specific attack vectors within the broader context of an application."

**Five recommendations for using AI safely in security:**

1. **Don't get complacent** -- Reliance on AI quick fixes can cause developers to overlook vulnerabilities. One founder reported AI made undocumented changes to code he didn't catch for weeks.

2. **Understand AI-generated code** -- Simply checking for errors isn't sufficient; developers must comprehend what the code does.

3. **Use AI as a checker, not sole solution** -- Several indie hackers use AI to triple-check work or audit existing scripts, though human review remains essential.

4. **Ask high-level questions** -- LexBoost co-founder Erwin Lengkeek uses AI only for infrastructure guidance, avoiding direct code generation.

5. **Consult experienced developers** -- Human expertise should complement, not replace, AI assistance.

**Key Lessons:**
- "AI might offer solutions for smaller, isolated issues, but when it comes to larger-scale security concerns, its effectiveness is questionable."
- Enterprise security audits cost $16-$20k; AI offers cheaper, instant alternatives
- AI hallucinations and context-blindness create dangerous blind spots
- Building security-first mindset matters more than reactive fixes

**Tech Stack Mentioned:**
- Cursor (AI code editor)
- defendsaas.com (security startup)
- Static analysis tools (traditional approach recommended)
