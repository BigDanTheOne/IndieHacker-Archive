Marc Lou, founder of the popular boilerplate ShipFast, issued a public apology following intense backlash over security vulnerabilities in his product. The controversy erupted when indie hacker Simon began publicly reporting bugs, sparking broader community discussion about boilerplate reliability.

In his response, Marc acknowledged that he prioritized rapid shipping over security during ShipFast's early stages when user numbers were minimal. He emphasized that "shipping fast does not mean shipping irresponsibly," committing to fix reported bugs and conduct comprehensive testing across all his products.

Marc also addressed why public bug disclosure poses problems. He described receiving hacking attempts, fraudulent transactions, and chargebacks following the public reports. Without his established Stripe reputation, he suggested newer indie hackers might face account suspension under similar circumstances.

The apology generated mixed reactions. Some, like Tibo and Levels, praised his accountability and recovery approach. Others, including Kaan Yagci and Balazs Orban, criticized the delayed response and questioned whether security should ever be deprioritized, regardless of user scale.

## Key Lessons

- Security should be foundational, not an afterthought
- Transparent accountability helps rebuild trust
- Public bug disclosure creates security risks for single-developer products
- Balancing rapid iteration with responsible practices requires scaling differently
