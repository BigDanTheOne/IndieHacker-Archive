Roman Czerny, a 30-year-old founder based in Lisbon, Portugal, shares his journey building Gojiberry AI, an intent-based LinkedIn outreach tool. After selling his first SaaS product (CocoAI) for seven figures, he identified a winning growth tactic and decided to productize it.

**Background:** Czerny began his entrepreneurial journey in 2019 as a freelancer, then moved into affiliate marketing before discovering his passion for SaaS in 2023.

**The Discovery:** His previous e-commerce SaaS revealed that founders actively engaging on LinkedIn around specific topics converted significantly better. Rather than build immediately, the team manually searched LinkedIn for qualified prospects—a process that often took 5+ hours to find 100 leads but proved highly effective.

**Manual Validation Phase:** Instead of writing code initially, Czerny spent an entire summer manually performing lead research with virtual assistants based in Pakistan and India. This painful, unscalable process served a critical purpose: proving genuine customer demand and satisfaction existed before any product development.

**Product Development:** The team later automated this proven manual process using AWS, Framer, Firebase, Gemini, Claude, and ChatGPT.

**Growth Strategy:** Rather than relying on a single channel, Czerny employed a multi-dimensional approach:
- Reddit for building early trust within SaaS communities
- LinkedIn through viral content combined with proprietary outbound campaigns
- Cold email at scale
- Strategic influencer partnerships with established B2B voices
- YouTube tutorials, newsletter sponsorships, and webinars

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $27,000 MRR at beginning of December
- $35,000 in sales during December 2025
- Previous exit (CocoAI): Seven-figure acquisition price

**Key Lessons:**
- "To build the MVP, we did not write a single line of product code. Instead, we first focused on getting customers."
- Founder-market fit matters: leverage the exact growth methodology that powered previous success
- Consistency over silver bullets: "showing up everywhere, every single day"
- ICP narrowing: Initially attempting to serve multiple customer profiles diluted effectiveness
- Outcome-driven results: prioritize measurable business outcomes over vanity metrics
- Built-in expansion revenue occurs naturally as teams grow

**Tech Stack:**
