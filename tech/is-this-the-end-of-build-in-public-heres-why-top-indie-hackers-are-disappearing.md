The article discusses how the "build in public" movement -- once celebrated for creating transparency and community -- is experiencing a significant shift. Originally popularized by Buffer and Ghost, the movement inspired thousands of founders to share their progress, revenue metrics, and growth trajectories openly.

However, a notable trend has emerged: successful indie hackers are increasingly retreating from public visibility. They're removing revenue statistics, deleting product URLs from social media bios, and entering what the article calls "stealth mode" to protect their businesses from copycat competitors.

## Revenue Numbers

- $10K MRR threshold: Suggested as the point where founders should stop sharing revenue statistics
- $30K MRR threshold: Suggested as the point where founders should minimize public visibility entirely
- Marc Lou's January 2025 earnings: $124,772 total across multiple projects
  - CodeFast: $82.6K
  - ShipFast: $36.2K
  - Multiple smaller projects under $2K each
- Sabba Keynejad's VEED.IO: Scaled to $500K MRR
- MVP Agencies and boilerplates: Mentioned achieving $10K-$20K within first months before declining

## Key Lessons

1. **Phased Transparency Approach:**
   - Phase 1 (0-$10K MRR): Share openly to attract early users and build accountability
   - Phase 2 ($10K+ MRR): Enter "ghost mode" -- delete revenue stats but share non-metric wins like customer stories
   - Phase 3 ($30K+ MRR): Share only occasional milestones sparingly

2. **Copycat Economics:** While copycats proliferate when revenue becomes public, most fail to sustain. They lack the execution, branding, and marketing subtleties that create genuine competitive moats. However, they still capture market share and create stress.

3. **Mental Health Considerations:** Public revenue figures amplify stress during downturns. Founders report 10x increased dread when performance metrics are visible to the world.

4. **Safety Concerns:** Publicizing substantial earnings raises personal security risks in certain geographic contexts.

5. **Community vs. Protection:** Building in public remains valuable for early-stage founders seeking motivation, feedback, and community support -- but the benefits diminish once achieving meaningful revenue.

6. **Execution Beats Imitation:** Strong execution, customer relationships, and brand loyalty ultimately outpace copycat threats.
