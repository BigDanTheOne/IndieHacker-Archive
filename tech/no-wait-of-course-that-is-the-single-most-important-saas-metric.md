The article presents six competing perspectives on the most critical SaaS metric:

1. **Retention** - Signals product-market fit and prevents exponential cancellation that eventually exceeds linear growth from new customers.

2. **Top-line Growth** - Demonstrates overall business health, ability to reach customers, market validation, and determines equity value through power-law dynamics.

3. **Net-profit Growth** - Reflects the market's shift post-2015 toward rewarding sustainable, profitable growth rather than growth-at-any-cost models.

4. **Sales Efficiency** - Indicates genuine product-market fit versus artificial growth; high acquisition costs suggest forced market adoption rather than organic embrace.

5. **LTV (Lifetime Value)** - Combines multiple metrics into a holistic business model picture, though dependent on future predictions.

6. **Rule of 40** - Balances growth rate plus profit margin to address companies across different lifecycle phases.

The article also mentions **NPS (Net Promoter Score)** as measuring ultimate value creation, affecting word-of-mouth marketing, retention, and organizational health.

**Key Conclusion:**
"The purpose of a metric is to be a tool in service of your goals... not a master you thoughtlessly obey." The optimal metric depends on company stage, industry, circumstance, and immediate priorities.
