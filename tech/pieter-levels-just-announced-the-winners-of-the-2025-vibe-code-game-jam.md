The 2025 Vibe Code Game Jam drew 1,170 game submissions, with winners determined by adherence to specific constraints rather than traditional game design excellence.

Top prize winners: The Great Taxi Assignment by Tomas Bencko ($10,000) -- described as "a fun GTA-like taxi driver simulator." Vibeware by Matt Gordon ($5,000) -- "a game where you play a bot who is given tasks." Vector Tango by Scoble ($2,500) -- "an air traffic control simulator."

Competition requirements included minimum 80% AI-generated code and assets, web-based and instantly playable without authentication, free to play, and teams limited to 1-4 members.

Pieter Levels initiated this trend in February by creating Fly, a viral flight simulator, subsequently sparking industry interest in AI-assisted game development. Sponsors included Bolt.new, Coderabbit.ai, and Lambda API.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $10,000 first place prize
- $5,000 second place prize
- $2,500 third place prize
- 1,170 game submissions

**Key Lessons:**
- AI-assisted game development is gaining mainstream traction
- Minimum 80% AI-generated code requirement validates vibe coding viability
- Web-based, instant-play, free-to-play constraints mirror modern distribution best practices
- Competition constraints rather than traditional excellence criteria drive innovation
