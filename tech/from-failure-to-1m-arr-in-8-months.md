Jordan Gal, founder of Rosie, shares how he pivoted from a failed VC-backed company called Rally to build an AI voice product that achieved $1M ARR within eight months.

Gal had been entrepreneurial throughout his career. His previous company, Rally, raised seed and Series A funding but struggled with slow growth despite reaching several hundred thousand in ARR. Recognizing that "everything was harder than it should have been," he decided to pivot rather than continue struggling.

He deliberately targeted AI voice, observing that existing solutions sounded unnatural and poor-quality. He viewed this weakness as a positive signal. He narrowed focus to self-serve, low-friction products for small and medium-sized businesses, intentionally avoiding the enterprise sales model.

The team reduced to six people and spent approximately 90 days building version one, prioritizing speed and quality. They deliberately overbuilt features while rushing to launch, then removed ignored functionalities based on early user feedback.

Initial customer acquisition used cold email campaigns (~1,000 emails daily for two months). Once they had initial users, they shifted to Meta and Google advertising, which became their primary acquisition channel.

A significant setback occurred when a Google PMax campaign appeared successful based on signup metrics but generated lower-converting customers. This taught Gal to track post-signup conversion rather than signup volume alone.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Rally (previous): Few hundred thousand in ARR
- Rosie: $1M ARR within 8 months
- Base plan: $49/mo
- Current: >$1MM/month

**Key Lessons:**
- Pivot from failing ventures decisively
- Target underperforming categories: weaknesses signal future improvement potential
- Prioritize speed with lean teams (six people, 90 days)
- Remove unused features post-launch
- Track post-purchase metrics, not just signup volume
- Start with cold outreach; scale with paid advertising
- "Whatever you think you need to start, you need less"
- Focus on after-tax personal income rather than vanity metrics

**Tech Stack:**
Laravel, Bland.ai (AI infrastructure), Mailreef and Clay (cold email), Meta and Google ads
