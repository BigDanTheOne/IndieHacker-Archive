Pieter Levels is discontinuing TherapistAI, his AI-powered therapy application, approximately four months after its launch in April 2024. Levels attributed the shutdown to insufficient growth momentum. He noted that "I could see this maybe work if it becomes more advanced like create a therapy plan, but it'd take a lot of work."

The piece includes a screenshot of a declining Stripe MRR graph, suggesting revenue diminishment over time.

Courtland Allen clarifies an important regulatory issue: the term "therapist" is regulated in most jurisdictions, typically requiring licensure to practice legally. This creates potential legal liability for operating such an application without proper credentials.

## Revenue Numbers

- ~$1,500/month MRR (referenced in comments as context)

## Key Lessons

- Regulatory terminology matters; using protected professional terms creates legal exposure
- Explosive initial launch momentum doesn't guarantee sustainable business viability
- Advanced features and comprehensive functionality may be necessary for market differentiation

**Tech Stack:** Stripe
