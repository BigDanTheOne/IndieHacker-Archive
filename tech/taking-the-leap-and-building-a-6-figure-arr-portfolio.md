Pauline Clavelloux, a French tech entrepreneur who spent 9.5 years at IBM, transitioned to full-time indie hacking during COVID. She built several SaaS products: IACrea (AI-powered real estate marketing), Feedbask (customer feedback widget), Subclip (automatic video subtitles), and Refindie (affiliate management tool).

Her journey began with fear and hesitation, but witnessing friends launch online projects during the pandemic provided the catalyst. Her first venture—a crypto trading bot—failed commercially but succeeded personally, teaching her the joy of building independently.

Clavelloux adopted a lean methodology: building quickly with minimal polish, launching early, gathering feedback, and improving only high-impact elements. Her first IACrea version supported only single photo uploads returning one AI image, yet attracted paying users.

For distribution, she emphasized that "Building is easy, distribution is hard." Different products required tailored approaches—IACrea succeeded through Facebook groups and networking; others through social media and building in public.

Her tech stack remained consistent: Next.js and Tailwind CSS frontend, Supabase for authentication/database/storage, Stripe for payments, and Vercel/AWS for hosting.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- 100K+ EUR ARR in 2024
- Revenue increased in 2025
- >$8.3K monthly

**Key Lessons:**
- Don't wait to be "ready" before sharing work
- Build in public and solicit early user feedback
- Launch imperfect products to validate demand
- Systematize repetitive tasks
- Prioritize learning speed over perfection
- Expect multiple failures before success
- Distribution requires as much deliberate practice as product building
- Solve personal pain points first

**Tech Stack:**
Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Stripe, Polar, Vercel, AWS
