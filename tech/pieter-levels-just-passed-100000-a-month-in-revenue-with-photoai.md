Pieter Levels achieved a significant revenue milestone with his AI photoshoot platform. Levels launched PhotoAI in February 2023, and it has become his most profitable application.

Levels stated: "Passed $100,000/mo with PhotoAI which is crazy!" He clarifies this represents monthly revenue rather than recurring monthly revenue, as many customers purchase discounted annual plans.

Levels indicates the revenue surge relates to recent media attention, specifically mentioning exposure from the Lex Fridman podcast, though he notes the challenge of converting that momentum into sustained user growth.
