Luke Marshall is CEO of Baremetrics, which was acquired by Xenon Partners in 2020 for $4M cash. Marshall has been focused on growing the analytics platform toward a $10M ARR target.

Baremetrics provides subscription analytics for SaaS companies. They employ tiered pricing aligned with customer growth, positioning themselves to benefit when clients succeed. They also offer Recover, a dunning tool with ROI guarantees. Prices had been unchanged for 8 years before a 2022 adjustment. Their free tier covers businesses up to 30k MRR.

Marshall emphasizes limiting quarterly goals to two major initiatives ("big rocks") alongside baseline operations, noting that "if everything is a priority, nothing is." Over the last 24 months, churn has been reduced by 50%.

On the technical side, building robust infrastructure matters; technical debt accumulates when rapid feature releases take precedence over system design. Traditional SEO effectiveness has diminished; AI search disruption requires multi-channel approaches including Reddit and LinkedIn community engagement.

Marshall advocates selling to build--letting actual user demand shape roadmaps rather than assumptions.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Acquisition price: $4 million (all cash, 2020)
