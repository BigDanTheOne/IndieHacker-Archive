Yoni Smolyar is a software engineer and chronic side hustler who has launched and failed at dozens of projects over the past decade. He started posting daily vlogs about his entrepreneurial journey approximately 450 days before this interview, building an audience of roughly 250,000 followers.

Smolyar became addicted to social media and experienced "brain rot"—diminished attention span, poor memory retention, and cognitive decline at age 27. Rather than complaining, he built Brainrot, a subscription-based mobile application that visualizes screen time addiction.

The app was built using Swift, with Superwall for the paywall and Posthog for analytics. Development took two months, with Smolyar completely rebuilding midway through. The app faced six rejections from Apple's App Store before final approval.

Brainrot generated $26,000 in revenue within its first 30 days. Product Hunt featured the app in their morning spotlight email, propelling it to #1 and generating 10,000+ downloads in one day. His 200,000+ social media followers drove another 5,000 downloads.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $26,000 in first 30 days
- 250,000 social media followers at launch
- 10,000+ downloads from Product Hunt in one day
- 5,000 downloads from personal social announcement

**Key Lessons:**
- Build for personal pain points first
- Audience compounds over time: Consistent public building across multiple failed projects builds trust
- Personal brand durability: Transparency about failures builds credibility
- "Build in Public. Don't operate in the shadows"
- "Competition is a fake concept...there are such an abstractly huge number of people online"
- Algorithms favor consistency: Regular posting generates organic distribution
- Technical founders need marketing partners

**Tech Stack:**
Swift (iOS), Superwall (paywall), Posthog (analytics), Cursor, Claude Code
