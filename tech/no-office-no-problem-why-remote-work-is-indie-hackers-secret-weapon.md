Remote work has become the dominant preference among professionals. According to FlexJobs data, "95% of professionals want remote or hybrid work options," with fewer than 10% preferring full-time office presence. The article notes that 40% of employees would consider leaving their jobs to pursue more flexible arrangements.

For indie hackers, remote work provides significant advantages: access to global talent, cost reduction, and schedule flexibility. The piece highlights that flexibility now outranks salary as a priority for many workers. Gumroad's Sahil Lavingia exemplifies this approach, offering competitive rates ($125-175/hr) regardless of location.

Productivity metrics present mixed results. While "77% of professionals say they get more done when working remotely," research also suggests some remote workers demonstrate minimal productivity. Remote employees report lower stress (40%), reduced burnout, and better sleep quality (36%).

Cost savings are substantial: employees save approximately $10.5K annually on commutes and meals, while employers save roughly $10K per remote worker on office space.

Challenges include isolation (affecting nearly 50% of indie hackers), overwork, collaboration difficulties, and technical issues. The article recommends asynchronous communication tools and reliable systems as solutions.

**Key Lessons:**
- Remote work attracts superior talent globally
- Flexibility matters more to workers than compensation
- Significant cost reductions for both employees and employers
- Asynchronous workflows enable distributed team success
