Tornado Cash is a service that anonymizes cryptocurrency transactions by mixing them with other transactions to obscure the origin of funds. The U.S. sanctioned it in 2022 due to its use by criminals, including North Korean hackers laundering stolen assets.

On November 26, 2024, a U.S. Federal Appeals Court overturned the sanctions, ruling that the Tornado Cash smart contracts cannot be sanctioned because they are not "property of a foreign national or entity."

The ruling has significant implications for privacy-focused crypto products. Tornado Cash's token TORN surged nearly 870% following the decision. Legal experts like Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal argued that "blocking open source technology entirely because a small portion of users are bad actors is not what Congress authorized."

**Key Lessons:**
- Open-source code faces legal distinctions from sanctionable property
- Privacy technology's legitimate uses must be weighed against misuse potential
- Regulatory clarity favors privacy-preserving cryptocurrency protocols

**Tech Stack Mentioned:**
- Smart contracts
