The article examines how indie developers with small social media followings achieved viral success with AI-assisted games, countering the narrative that Pieter Levels' 600K+ X followers solely drove his game's popularity.

## Featured Creators and Games

- Reagan Maconi (520 followers) - Combat Mission (1.5K likes)
- Nicola Manzini (3,302 followers) - Vibe Sail (1.6K likes)
- Nicolas Zullo (2,265 followers) - WW2 Dogfight Arena (2.9K likes)
- Cemil Sevim (353 followers) - Battle Tank (1.1K likes)
- Jay Codes (1,205 followers) - Space Balls (2.2K likes)

## Key Lessons

1. **Build high-quality games** - Successful projects replicated proven game concepts (Agar.io, flight simulators) rather than creating entirely new categories.

2. **Piggyback on viral posts** - Creators strategically commented on popular tweets, including Levels' frequent game updates, gaining exposure through existing viral threads.

3. **Ship constantly and share publicly** - "It's not enough to build a high-quality game, or to score the occasional high-engagement tweet." Nicola Manzini averaged 20+ daily posts, including updates about lacking updates.
