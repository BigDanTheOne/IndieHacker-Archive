Mas Hossain began coding at age 10, building websites for Twitch streamers and startups. He launched an agency, then created Queue—a platform enabling agency owners to manage billing, projects, reviews, and feedback centrally. The product emerged from personal frustration: "just me, staying up late, trying to make clients happy and get paid."

Hossain prioritized intuitive design, believing friction causes user loss. He developed the initial version using Ruby on Rails for the API and React for the frontend. His approach emphasized simplicity: "Build something, get tough feedback, improve it, and repeat."

Early marketing efforts were minimal—acknowledged as a significant mistake. Breakthrough growth came through community participation. By consistently helping others while maintaining visibility as "Mas from usequeue dot com," he generated organic interest without aggressive pitching.

Hossain also executed personalized outbound campaigns, recording Loom videos demonstrating how Queue solved specific prospect challenges.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- >$83K monthly revenue (7-figure ARR)
- First hire milestone: $250K ARR with 5-person team

**Key Lessons:**
- Founder-market fit matters most: Building from lived experience provides authentic problem-solving
- Community engagement outperforms traditional marketing
- Early marketing neglect was costly
- Design quality prevents user churn: Intuitive interfaces are non-negotiable
- Bootstrapping approach works: Profitability and organic growth precede venture investment
- Personalization scales differently: Loom videos demonstrated higher engagement than generic outreach

**Tech Stack:**
Ruby on Rails (backend), React (frontend)
