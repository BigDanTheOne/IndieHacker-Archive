OpenAI has agreed to purchase Windsurf, an AI-powered coding startup, in what would be OpenAI's largest acquisition to date. The $3 billion transaction has been agreed upon but remains unclosed, with neither company officially confirming the deal.

Notably, OpenAI previously attempted to acquire Cursor before selecting Windsurf as an alternative target, according to reporting from Bloomberg and Reuters.

The acquisition strengthens OpenAI's competitive position against rivals developing AI coding solutions, positioning the company against Microsoft's GitHub Copilot and Anthropic's developer tools within the crowded AI-assisted coding market.

Windsurf offers distinctive features including "Cascade" technology maintaining contextual awareness across entire codebases, multi-file editing powered by AI, agentic coding approaches transcending simple autocomplete, and enterprise-focused features for organizations managing complex codebases.

Windsurf reportedly serves several hundred thousand daily active users and has gained traction with large enterprises handling million-line codebases.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $3 billion acquisition price
- Several hundred thousand daily active users

**Key Lessons:**
- OpenAI is committed to controlling broader developer workflow infrastructure, not just API access
- Contextual awareness across entire codebases ("Cascade") is a key differentiator
- Enterprise-focused features for complex codebases drive adoption
- The AI-assisted coding market is intensely competitive with multiple major players
