President-elect Donald Trump has reversed his earlier stance on TikTok. During his first term, he claimed the app was "nothing more than Chinese spyware" and attempted to ban it in 2020, though courts blocked the action. The Biden administration continued pressure, with Biden signing legislation in April requiring ByteDance to divest its stake by January 2025 or face a ban.

Trump now opposes the ban. Possible reasons include TikTok's popularity among young voters who supported his election, his rivalry with Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, or influence from billionaire megadonor Jeff Yass.

The author notes Trump faces a dilemma: the ban passed Congress with bipartisan support, leaving only two viable paths -- urge Congressional repeal or instruct his Attorney General not to enforce the law. The latter appears more feasible given the political difficulty of repealing established legislation.

**Key Lessons:** Political positions can shift; enforcement discretion can be as powerful as legislation; bipartisan consensus makes policy reversal challenging.
