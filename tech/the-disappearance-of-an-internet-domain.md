On October 3, the British government announced sovereignty transfer of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. This geopolitical shift will trigger the retirement of the .io domain -- a country code top-level domain (ccTLD) tied to the British Indian Ocean Territory.

The .io domain gained prominence in tech circles through usage by Github.io, itch.io, and Google I/O. While often attributed to "input/output" terminology, its legitimacy stems from ISO country code designation.

The UK and US have operated a military base on the Chagos Islands since 1968. Mauritius disputed British sovereignty since their 1968 independence, claiming illegal retention. A new treaty grants a 99-year military lease while transferring island control to Mauritius. Consequently, the British Indian Ocean Territory will cease existing as a political entity.

When the ISO removes country code "IO," IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) will halt new .io registrations and begin retiring existing domains within three to five years.

## Historical Context

The article traces precedent through previous domain crises:

- **USSR (.su domain):** Created September 19, 1990; USSR collapsed within months. The domain became "a barely policed top-level domain" and vehicle for "Russian dark ops" without clear governance rules.

- **Yugoslavia (.yu domain):** Slovenian academics allegedly broke into the University of Belgrade in late 1992, stealing hosting software and domain records. They controlled .yu unofficially for two years, blocking Serbian institution registrations. IANA manager Jon Postel forcibly transferred control back to Belgrade in 1994.

- **Serbia/Montenegro (.rs and .me):** Created in 2006 following Montenegro's independence, with mandatory .yu termination by 2010.

## Key Lessons

1. Geopolitics directly impact digital infrastructure
2. Domain selection carries long-term political risks
3. Institutional rules, once established, constrain flexibility
4. "Physical history is never as separate from our digital future as we like to think"
