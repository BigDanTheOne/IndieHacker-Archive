Einar Vollset, a former Cornell professor with a PhD in Computer Science, accidentally built a bootstrapped investment bank. After selling his second business in 2015-16, he was drawn into technical due diligence work for private equity firms. During a dinner conversation, he learned about deal flow commissions—paying brokers who introduce acquisition targets.

Vollset became the go-to advisor for founders receiving unsolicited PE acquisition offers. Recognizing systematic undervaluation of SaaS businesses, he transitioned from informal advice to formally brokering transactions. He discovered that PE firms were increasingly acquiring smaller SaaS companies (down to $1M ARR, previously rare before 2010).

**Discretion Capital & TinySeed:**
Vollset founded two entities: Discretion Capital (a bootstrapped investment bank charging success fees) and TinySeed (a fund for bootstrapped founders). Instead of hiring MBAs or purchasing expensive databases like PitchBook, he built proprietary web scrapers tracking PE firms worldwide and their portfolios. These systems evolved to incorporate AI technology while maintaining core functionality.

**Business Model & Growth:**
Discretion Capital operates on success-based compensation tied to transaction value, creating variable revenue tied directly to deal success. The firm initially targeted $1-10M ARR companies, expanding to $2-20M ARR. Growth occurred entirely through word-of-mouth referrals after delivering dramatically improved offers—often 300% above initial PE proposals.

**Market Challenges:**
The biggest obstacle involves educating technical founders about investment banking value. Most technical founders (95% of clients) view traditional investment bankers skeptically, initially considering brokers unnecessary middlemen. Founders underestimate market opacity and the disadvantage of selling a business only once versus repeat buyers using established playbooks.

**Competitive Advantage:**
Vollset's technical background differentiates Discretion Capital from competitors. Traditional investment banks assign junior employees—often resentful about "small" deals and technically unsophisticated—to mid-market transactions. Technical credibility combined with founder empathy creates trust that typical investment banking relationships lack.

**Key Advice:**
Vollset emphasizes rejecting anti-sales attitudes. He advocates asking: "What can I build that someone would pay $500 or $5000 monthly for?" This framework grounds business decisions in demonstrable customer value rather than assumptions.

**Transaction Volume:**
Over recent years, Discretion Capital has facilitated "well above $100M in transaction volume yearly."

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $100M+ deal volume yearly
- Target client ARR ranges: initially $1-10M, expanded to $2-20M
- Success fee model (percentage of transaction price)

**Key Lessons:**
- Build proprietary technology to compete against expensive enterprise tools
- Market opacity creates genuine value for informed brokers
- Technical credibility builds trust with skeptical founder audiences
- Don't be anti-sales—distribution matters as much as product
- Word-of-mouth compounds when delivering outsized value (300% offer improvements)
- One-time, high-stakes decisions favor expert guidance over DIY approaches

**Tech Stack:**
Custom web scrapers, AI-enhanced data systems, internal PE firm portfolio tracking systems
