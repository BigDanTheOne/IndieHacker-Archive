This comprehensive comparison examines two leading AI-powered code editors through hands-on testing and real-world usage scenarios. The reviewers evaluated both tools across multiple project types including browser games, SaaS applications, and codebase refactoring tasks, assessing build success rates, completion times, token consumption, and user experience quality.

Windsurf demonstrated superior UX design with polished features, including a one-click deploy button, integrated website preview, and improved file selector reliability. The authors noted that "Windsurf goes the extra mile to add thoughtful design" features that enhanced usability.

Cursor's agent completed long-running tasks significantly faster--approximately 25-40% quicker than Windsurf--though code quality remained comparable between both editors.

On pricing, Windsurf offers 25% cheaper monthly rates with a credit-based system (500 credits/month at $20). Cursor provides 50 requests/month on the free tier with unlimited "slow" requests available on the Pro plan.

The authors advocate using both editors simultaneously, suggesting this approach optimizes costs, enables experimentation, and provides efficiency benefits without additional overhead.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Windsurf: 500 credits/month at $20
- Cursor: 50 requests/month on free tier; Pro plan available

**Key Lessons:**
- Both tools deliver similar underlying code quality
- Windsurf has superior UX design with polished features
- Cursor completes long-running tasks 25-40% faster
- Using both editors simultaneously optimizes costs and enables experimentation
- The choice depends on workflow preferences and speed requirements rather than output superiority
