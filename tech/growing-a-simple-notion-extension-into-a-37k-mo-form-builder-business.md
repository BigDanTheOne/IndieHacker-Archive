Julien Nahum, 28, a Paris-born entrepreneur who studied engineering before pivoting to computer science in London, discovered the indie hacking community while working at AWS. After moving back to Paris, he decided to pursue entrepreneurship full-time.

When Notion released its API, Nahum spent three to four days building NoteForms (originally NotionForms), the first Notion extension available. The scrappy MVP allowed users to create forms with Notion database properties as inputs without sharing database access. He launched without monetization plans and even listed it on Acquire before realizing its potential.

After three months, Nahum introduced a $15/month pro plan. "I remember the first day just waiting for the first payment notification to appear." Pricing increased to $19, then $24, with team-tier options added later.

Growth occurred organically through community engagement -- Reddit, Facebook groups, Twitter, and Slack channels. The viral nature of forms (users embed and share them) provided natural growth. The "Created with NoteForms" attribution link helped SEO and word-of-mouth marketing.

To diversify, Nahum launched OpnForm, an open-source, Notion-independent form builder with both free and paid hosting options. He's also developing an Airtable form builder.

## Revenue Numbers

- $15/month (initial pricing)
- $19/month (first increase)
- $24/month (current pricing)
- $3,000/month (early milestone)
- $10,000/month (significant milestone)
- $37,000/month (current revenue)

## Key Lessons

1. Building an MVP in days and launching quickly provided first-mover advantage
2. Platform diversification reduces risk
3. Organic community engagement drives growth
4. Forms naturally generate sharing and embedding, amplifying visibility
5. Don't overthink monetization -- start free, test demand, then introduce pricing
6. "Indie hacking has given me so much freedom...100% be able to control your time."
