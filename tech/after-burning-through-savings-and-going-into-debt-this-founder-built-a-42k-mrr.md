Rashid Khasanov is a non-technical bootstrapped founder who has been building SaaS applications for six years. After his first app completely failed, draining his savings and maxing out credit cards, he rebuilt by creating Angel Match—a fundraising platform helping startup founders locate investors, manage outreach, and share updates.

The platform was born from his personal frustration struggling to find investors for that failed initial venture. Today, Angel Match generates $37.3K MRR. Khasanov also operates Investor Hunt ($4,557 MRR), Pur Social ($491 MRR), and Journalist Hunt ($180 MRR).

**Early Journey & Learning from Failure**

Khasanov's first app was an SEC-registered robo-advisor—expensive to operate without venture capital. He emphasizes that bootstrapped founders should test simple applications solving single problems rather than pursuing "shiny" unicorn ideas. His approach involves "test a lot of things and double down on what works."

He hired a remote software developer to build Angel Match from scratch. The initial version had numerous bugs but generated revenue quickly.

**Growth Strategies**

- Building free tools launched on Product Hunt, Indie Hackers, Reddit, and startup directories
- Publishing consistent blog content
- Scheduling daily social media posts
- Email marketing through onboarding flows and newsletters
- Meta ads (February-October 2025) achieving 1.6x ROAS
- Programmatic SEO creating structured pages at scale

**Critical Turning Point**

Angel Match remained stuck at approximately $5K MRR until Khasanov hired an in-house SEO expert. He discovered the platform was inadvertently deleting pages during updates, preventing search traffic compounding. Once corrected, organic growth accelerated dramatically.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Angel Match: $37.3K MRR
- Investor Hunt: $4,557 MRR
- Pur Social: $491 MRR
- Journalist Hunt: $180 MRR
- Total Portfolio: $42K MRR
- Target: $100K MRR

**Key Lessons:**
- Solve "boring problems" people currently handle with spreadsheets or manual workflows
- Persistence beats hype; consistency compounds over years
- SEO provides reliable long-term organic growth if properly maintained
- Direct user feedback—especially cancellation reasons—reveals product priorities
- Remote hiring enables bootstrapping when US-based talent is cost-prohibitive
- Database products have stronger moats than AI wrappers vulnerable to platform updates
- Hands-on customer service teaches more than passive learning

**Tech Stack:**
Node.js, Digital Ocean, Figma, Stripe, Klaviyo (email marketing)
