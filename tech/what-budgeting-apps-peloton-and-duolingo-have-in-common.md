The core framework discussed is the Hook Model, consisting of four stages:

1. **Cue** -- Initial trigger prompting engagement (e.g., Duolingo's streak notifications)
2. **Action** -- Small, achievable steps using progress bars to leverage the Zeigarnik Effect
3. **Reward** -- Variable rewards like badges and achievements providing dopamine reinforcement
4. **Investment** -- Long-term tracking showing cumulative progress and creating commitment

The article demonstrates how Duolingo, Peloton, and Mint each implement these stages differently but effectively. Duolingo uses daily streak notifications and language levels. Peloton employs workout challenges and ride histories. Mint leverages spending summaries and savings visualization.

The piece concludes by acknowledging both benefits and drawbacks: "while these techniques are powerful for building positive habits, they can also lead to 'app fatigue' over time."

**Key Lessons:**
- Habit-building apps use identical psychological frameworks despite different domains
- Progress visualization and variable rewards drive sustained engagement
- Long-term commitment increases when users see accumulated progress
- App proliferation risks user overwhelm despite individual effectiveness
