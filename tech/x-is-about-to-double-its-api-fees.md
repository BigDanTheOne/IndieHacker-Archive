X is implementing significant API pricing increases targeting indie developers. The Basic tier monthly cost doubles from $100 to $200, while Pro remains at $5,000/month. Free users gain limited read access (50 posts/month) instead of previous write-only capabilities.

The platform previously implemented tiered pricing in 2023 after Elon Musk's acquisition. These new hikes represent a second escalation affecting developers who adapted to initial increases.

According to developer Daniel Nguyen, X poses "a huge risk" for builders due to unstable policies. The pricing appears designed to generate alternative revenue given advertising struggles, rather than meaningfully address bot problems.

## Revenue Numbers

- Basic tier: $200/month (up from $100)
- Pro tier: $5,000/month (unchanged)
- Enterprise: $42,000 minimum
- Annual discounts: 25% Basic, 10% Pro

## Key Lessons

1. Platform dependency creates vulnerability for indie projects
2. API monetization can alienate developer ecosystems
3. Policy instability undermines trust and long-term building
4. Revenue pressures may override developer community health
