Simon Hamp developed NativePHP, a framework enabling PHP developers to build desktop and mobile applications without learning new languages. Following a voluntary redundancy in late 2022, he pursued this previously dismissed idea and launched the mobile version in February 2025, generating $100,000 in revenue within three months.

NativePHP uses static PHP compilation and the Tauri shell framework, delivered as a Composer package for Laravel integration. Hamp live-coded and compiled a Laravel app during his Laracon EU talk announcement, then released the first iPhone app built with PHP/Laravel to prove Apple App Store viability--a significant validation of the technology.

Hamp invests approximately 10% of gross income back into community engagement, sponsoring meetups and supporting developers, which he says yields strong returns. His cofounder Shane Rosenthal provided essential support throughout the process.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $100,000 in first 3 months
- $50,000 monthly run rate
- ~10% of gross income invested in community
- Next target: $500,000

**Key Lessons:**
- Release early: ship imperfect solutions rather than delay indefinitely
- Charge money promptly: use payment to validate perceived value
- Validate with your actual audience, not periphery contacts
- Iterate continuously: develop feedback loops
- Community engagement works: sponsoring meetups and supporting developers yields returns
- Don't overcomplicate pricing: set realistic rates based on target customer perspective
- Leverage existing tools: focus innovation on your unique proposition

**Tech Stack:**
C (PHP core and native extension development), Swift (iOS), Kotlin/Java (Android), Composer package, Laravel, static PHP compilation, Tauri shell framework
