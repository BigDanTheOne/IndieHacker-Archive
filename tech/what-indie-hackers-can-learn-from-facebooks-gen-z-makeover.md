Facebook has lost appeal with younger audiences, ranking as only the fifth most-used platform among Gen Z. Usage drops significantly with age -- only 33% of US teens aged 13-17 use Facebook. The platform responded with a Gen Z-focused redesign emphasizing local community engagement.

## Key Redesign Features

- **Local Tab:** Consolidates Marketplace, Groups, and Events content for discovering nearby items, events, and recommendations
- **Explore Tab:** Pinterest-style interface with "For You" and "Nearby" feeds
- **Video Tab:** Full-screen player for short-form, long-form, and live content
- **Events Tab:** Personalized event digests
- **Groups AI:** Helps members find answers (Groups has 1.8 billion users across 25 million active groups)
- **Dating Matchmaker:** Allows friends to swipe through matches
- **Messenger Communities:** Connect via shared interests

## Key Lessons for Indie Hackers

Gen Z priorities center on:
- "Scoring a deal"
- Local community connections
- Short-form video consumption
- Online group participation
- Digital dating

Gen Z is projected to become "the largest, wealthiest generation ever," making understanding their preferences strategically important.
