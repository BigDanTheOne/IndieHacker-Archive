The article discusses Joost de Valk's (former Yoast CEO) proposal to democratize WordPress governance. Following Matt Mullenweg's controversial actions during a feud with WP Engine, de Valk has outlined a vision for restoring community control.

## De Valk's Five-Point Plan

1. Establishing a WordPress foundation with diverse board representation
2. Transferring WordPress.org and community assets from private to foundation control
3. Making the WordPress trademark public domain or universally accessible
4. Creating transparent sponsorship programs
5. Forming independent teams for architecture, product, and events

Additionally, de Valk proposes FAIR (Federated and Independent Repositories) -- mirrors of WordPress.org that would prevent centralized control over the plugin ecosystem.

## Context

The article contextualizes recent WordPress turmoil, including Mullenweg's "commandeering" of WP Engine plugins and adding "pineapple pizza" login requirements. Community figures like David Heinemeier Hansson have criticized these actions.

## Key Lessons

- Centralized leadership in open-source projects creates vulnerability
- Community trust requires transparent governance
- Decentralization can protect ecosystems from unilateral control

## Tech Stack Mentioned

WordPress, WordPress plugins (Yoast), WordPress.org, WP Engine
