## Full Article Text

Kevin Natanzon transitioned from consumer app development to founding CreatorKit, an AI-powered video platform. After a decade building startups that reached 15 million users, he recognized the consumer app space had become saturated and unsustainable.

The turning point came around 2020 when app store algorithms changed and social media arbitrage channels dried up. His team realized their apps lacked defensibility and recurring user engagement. This prompted them to build "the online video platform we wish we had."

CreatorKit offers PRO and Business Plans with varying access to AI actors and monthly video generation limits. The platform differentiates itself through a proprietary video restoration model forked from GPFGAN, delivering hyperrealistic AI avatars that competitors couldn't match.

## Key Lessons

1. **Focus Over Everything:** "You can do ANYTHING, but not EVERYTHING." The founder overscoped initial features, delaying product-market fit.
2. **Shipping Velocity Matters:** Speed must balance quality—"Done is better than perfect" justified mediocrity until they prioritized single solutions excellently.
3. **Single Marketing Channel Suffices:** Rather than pursuing every growth avenue, one effective channel (SEO) proved sufficient for stage progression.
4. **AI Replaces Personal Branding Risk:** Using AI avatars eliminates dependency on individual creators; avatars remain "always available."
5. **Work-Life Balance Comes Later:** Successful ventures require extended periods of imbalance before equilibrium emerges.
6. **Action Over Analysis:** Experience teaches faster than theory—"Action produces information."

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js standard backend
- **Frontend:** React
- **AI Models:** Custom video restoration model (GPFGAN-forked)
- **Hosting:** AWS SageMaker and elastic GPU infrastructure
