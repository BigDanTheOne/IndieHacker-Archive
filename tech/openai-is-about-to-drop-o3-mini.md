OpenAI's o3-mini will launch in approximately two weeks, available simultaneously on both API and ChatGPT platforms. The reasoning model represents the second generation of OpenAI's advanced thinking systems, designed to mimic human-like cognitive processing.

According to CEO Sam Altman, o3-mini is "FAST" but performs worse than o1-pro on most benchmarks. The model will offer "real high" message rate limits on ChatGPT, with specific pricing for API access not yet disclosed.

The reasoning model family works by allocating additional processing time for complex problem-solving and self-correction before generating responses. OpenAI's o1 demonstrated superior performance on scientific reasoning benchmarks, though initial versions were slower.

Reasoning models have generated mixed user feedback, particularly among Pro subscribers who found results sometimes underperformed standard GPT models. However, experts note these models require different usage approaches -- more detailed prompts and clearer objective specification yield better results.

OpenAI has shifted strategic focus from AGI (artificial general intelligence) to ASI (artificial superintelligence).

## Key Lessons

1. Advanced reasoning models require different prompting strategies than conversational AI
2. Simultaneous API and consumer platform releases accelerate developer adoption
3. Performance comparisons between models should account for intended use cases

## Tech Stack Mentioned

- OpenAI o3-mini (reasoning model)
- OpenAI o1/o1-mini/o1-pro (predecessors)
