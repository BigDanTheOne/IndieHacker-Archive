The Open Source Initiative has established an official definition for open source AI after two years of consultation with academics, philosophers, and content creators. The four core freedoms required are: use without permission, study of system components, modification capabilities, and sharing rights for any purpose.

According to the definition, open source AI models must provide complete training details including code, settings, and weights for reproducibility. This standard aligns with existing open source software definitions but creates conflict with Meta's Llama models, which restrict commercial use and withhold training data access.

Meta disputes the definition, stating "There is no single open source AI definition, and defining it is a challenge because previous open source definitions do not encompass the complexities of today's rapidly advancing AI models."

The article notes Meta won't fully open-source Llama due to competitive concerns and potential copyright liability from training data inclusion. While the Open Source Initiative cannot enforce compliance, industry observers now recognize Meta as lacking true open source commitment.

## Key Lessons

- Formal standards matter for industry credibility
- Market leaders may resist definitions that challenge their positioning
- Openness involves tradeoffs between access and liability
