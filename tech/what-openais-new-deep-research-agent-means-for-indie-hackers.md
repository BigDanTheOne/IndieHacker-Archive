OpenAI has launched Deep Research, an autonomous agent that browses the web to compile detailed technical reports. The tool addresses limitations in AI models that struggle with comprehensive research on specialized topics.

## How It Works

Deep Research uses a "chain of thought" process, asking clarifying questions upfront before conducting multiple iterative web searches. It analyzes text, images, and PDFs, potentially taking up to 30 minutes to generate reports comparable to professional research analyst work.

## Access and Availability

Currently limited to ChatGPT interface with no API announced. Pro subscribers ($200/month) gain access immediately, with Plus ($20/month) and Teams users receiving access within approximately one month. European Union, UK, and EEA regions face delayed availability due to AI Act restrictions.

## Three Applications for Indie Hackers

1. **Idea Generation** -- Identifies niche markets and validates startup concepts through competitor analysis
2. **Content Creation** -- Provides data and statistics for newsletters, blogs, and YouTube channels
3. **Workflow Automation** -- Automates competitor analysis and trend monitoring when integrated with tools like Zapier or Notion

## Limitations

The tool still hallucinates, struggles distinguishing fact from rumor, and cannot convey uncertainty effectively. Users must verify facts before business application.

## Key Lessons

- Verify all facts before using reports in business decisions
- Deep Research automates research tasks but requires human fact-checking
- Geographic restrictions limit immediate global access

## Tech Stack Mentioned

- ChatGPT interface
- Zapier (mentioned for potential integration)
- Notion (mentioned for potential integration)
- Python analysis capabilities
