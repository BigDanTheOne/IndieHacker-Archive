VPN app demand surged dramatically in Florida following Pornhub's departure from the state. Between midnight and 4am on January 1st, analysts documented "an incredible 1150 percent spike in Floridians wanting to use a VPN to mask their public IP addresses."

The platform's exit wasn't unexpected -- it resulted from Florida's new social media legislation taking effect January 1st. This created a predictable opportunity window.

## Key Lesson for Indie Hackers

The author emphasizes that significant regulatory or industry changes typically provide advance warning. VPN app developers could anticipate and capitalize on the surge by positioning their products strategically when demand spikes. The underlying message: "Changes like these provide an opportunity to push your app at the right moment."

## Additional Note

The comments section highlights a critical insight -- distribution remains harder than product development for solo founders, even during demand surges.
