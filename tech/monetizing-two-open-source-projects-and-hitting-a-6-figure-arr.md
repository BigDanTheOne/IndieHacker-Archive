Manuel Astudillo, founder of Taskforce.sh, BullMQ, and Castmill, shares his journey from building open-source tools to generating six-figure annual recurring revenue.

Astudillo studied computer science and has programmed since childhood. He currently maintains two major projects: BullMQ (a distributed job processing library for Node.js built on Redis) and Castmill (an open-source digital signage solution). The combined ventures generate over $8,000 monthly with approximately 50% yearly growth.

**Origin Story:** BullMQ emerged around 2011-2012 as a personal project to fulfill Taskforce.sh requirements. Astudillo needed a dependable queue service for Node.js and couldn't find existing solutions meeting his standards. He published the library on NPM as open source, surprised when it gained significant traction through GitHub issue reports.

**First Monetization Attempt (Failed):** After years of managing growing feature requests and bug reports, Astudillo recognized monetization potential. He invested six months developing a Redis hosting solution integrated into a dashboard. The venture proved disastrous: growth stagnated, customer hosting issues created operational stress and sleep loss, and the service ultimately collapsed. He reflects that his expertise lay in queue technology rather than infrastructure hosting.

**Successful Pivot:** Astudillo shifted focus toward creating Taskforce.sh—a dashboard and SaaS product for managing BullMQ deployments. Development consumed approximately one year while maintaining employment and the open-source library. The primary funnel proved highly effective: README banners and text directing traffic to the paid offering.

**Growth Strategies:** Beyond the README funnel, Astudillo invested substantially in SEO optimization. He created comprehensive landing pages using tools like Ahrefs to identify improvement opportunities. A company blog features tutorials and technical content designed for Google indexing.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Over $8,000 per month (current run rate)
- Six-figure ARR
- Approximately 50% yearly growth rate
- Three months to acquire first eight paying customers

**Key Lessons:**
- Focus on unfair advantages: expertise in queue technology, not infrastructure hosting
- Psychological resilience matters: Extended development cycles demand persistent self-belief
- Leverage existing audiences: GitHub README visibility proved far more effective than other channels
- Choose sustainable monetization: Hosting created burnout; dashboard SaaS proved manageable
- Content and SEO compound: Blog tutorials took years but eventually drove meaningful traffic
- Open-source provides validation: Steady adoption validated market demand before building paid offerings

**Tech Stack:**
Angular (frontend), Node.js (backend, including BullMQ), PostgreSQL, Redis, Ahrefs (SEO)
