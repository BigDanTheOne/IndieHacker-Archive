Val Sopi, founder of BlogMaker, transitioned from running a successful service company to building SaaS products seeking more stable, recurring revenue. BlogMaker began as a personal challenge—creating a fully functional product within 20 hours in April 2021. The product is a blog engine designed for small teams and solo founders focused on SEO publishing.

Sopi went full-time on BlogMaker in October 2022 after noticing positive traction and retention. The business currently generates five-figure annual recurring revenue with 50% month-to-month growth.

## Development Approach

The initial 20-hour version split across three sessions resulted in a working product with immediate customer payment. The current implementation uses a customized forked version of CodeIgniter3 for backend operations and jQuery for frontend work. Sopi maintains zero external libraries to minimize dependency management overhead, a critical decision for solo operation.

## Growth and Distribution Strategy

Distribution proved challenging initially. Social media activity, particularly Twitter, did not effectively convert to new customers. Sopi shifted focus toward SEO and AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) as the most viable intent-based growth channels.

Two separate blogs drive growth: one covering feature updates and product news; another focusing on SEO strategy through "versus," "alternative to," and "how-to" articles. Recent partnerships, including integration with RightBlogger.com, further expanded reach.

## Pricing Evolution

BlogMaker initially offered only yearly pricing, which complicated sustainable business building. Transitioning to monthly subscriptions proved difficult due to existing market positioning. However, monthly recurring revenue recently nearly surpassed historical yearly subscription revenue, demonstrating sustainable growth potential. Sopi increased prices for new customers while offering existing clients graceful upgrade paths.

## Self-Care and Sustainability

Sopi emphasizes that personal wellness directly impacts product success. Previous burnout around 2020 prompted lifestyle changes including daily step targets (7,000+), gym visits (minimum four weekly), and meditation practice. These habits enhance patience, focus, and mental clarity essential for sustained building.

## Product-Market Fit Philosophy

Rather than focusing exclusively on product development, Sopi recommends investigating what customers currently purchase, which customer segments buy, and discovery mechanisms. Success requires understanding if the builder represents the right person to solve the identified problem and possesses genuine go-to-market advantages.

## Future Direction

Immediate goals include scaling BlogMaker to five-figure monthly recurring revenue with 80% profit margins. Long-term vision focuses on continuous iteration based on emerging technologies and customer requirements, particularly within the rapidly evolving SEO and AI landscape.

Sopi recently launched AMSDeck.com targeting larger organizations, developed through extensive research inspired by Rob Walling's SaaS Launchpad course.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Five-figure ARR
- >$5K per month
- 50% month-to-month growth rate

**Key Lessons:**
- Speed over perfection: Time constraints force prioritization and prevent feature bloat
- Distribution is foundational: Product quality matters less than reaching customers
- SEO provides sustainable growth for utility products
- Pricing requires iteration: Monthly flexibility often converts better than annual-only models
- Founder wellness is critical: Burnout directly undermines business success
- Maintain technical simplicity: Minimal dependencies reduce maintenance burden

**Tech Stack:**
CodeIgniter3 (customized fork), jQuery, zero external libraries
