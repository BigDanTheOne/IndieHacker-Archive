Patrick Morgan examines how artificial intelligence is fundamentally restructuring creative work through what he calls "unbundling" -- separating capabilities that historically required large organizations.

**Historical Context:** Traditional creative fields (writing, design, development) required institutional affiliation. Organizations bundled diverse talent, created scalable systems, and controlled distribution channels.

**Digital Disruption:** Software tools enhanced individual productivity but didn't eliminate organizational advantages until AI arrived. Morgan notes that AI represents "an entirely new creative workforce entering the economy."

**Current Impact:** The same technology empowering independent creators simultaneously enables organizations to operate with significantly fewer employees, particularly threatening junior-level execution roles.

**Emerging Winners:** "Versatile creators" who blend disciplines gain competitive advantage -- individuals capable of moving between tools like Midjourney and Claude while synthesizing cross-domain insights.

**Core Lessons:**
1. Unbundling creates opportunities for multidisciplinary independent creators
2. Traditional specialist roles face disruption
3. Strategic direction and novel idea synthesis increasingly differentiate creative value
4. Success requires combining AI capabilities with distinctly human creativity

**Tech Stack Referenced:**
- Midjourney (AI image generation)
- Claude (AI assistant)
