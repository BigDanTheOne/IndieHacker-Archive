Bruce McLachlan transitioned from a decade-long fintech career as Technical Director at Backbase to full-time indie entrepreneurship. After years of maintaining side projects, he discovered Cloakist on MicroAcquire generating approximately $2,000 monthly revenue. The platform enables users to connect webpages with custom domains.

McLachlan acquired Cloakist and systematically grew it by automating manual processes, enhancing onboarding flows, and investing heavily in SEO. He subsequently created Sotion, a specialized version targeting Notion websites, which eventually exceeded Cloakist's revenue performance.

The founder spent three years balancing full-time employment with entrepreneurial pursuits before stepping into a lighter role that ultimately led to burnout. In July 2025, after accumulating sufficient revenue and maintaining a financial buffer, he transitioned to full-time independent work.

When Notion launched competing website publishing functionality, rather than retreating, McLachlan differentiated Sotion through membership management features.

**Acquisition Due Diligence:** The selection process involved evaluating 83 listings, conducting 18 exploratory calls, submitting 6 letters of intent, completing 4 due diligence calls, and submitting 3 acquisition proposals before successfully acquiring one business.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Initial Cloakist acquisition: ~$2,000 MRR
- Current combined revenue: >$12,000 MRR
- Product portfolio: Cloakist, Sotion, AliasLinks, ZerpHost

**Key Lessons:**
- "Consider acquisition as a path; it reduces risk and gives you traction from day one"
- Avoiding over-engineering is critical; customer value drives business outcomes
- "Start SEO sooner. It compounds massively and is even more relevant with AI discovery"
- Resist customer requests outside core value proposition
- Early automation implementation purchases time for strategic initiatives
- "I wish I'd started years earlier. The freedom I have now is priceless. Worst case, you can always get another job"

**Tech Stack:**
React/Next.js, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, AWS, Cloudflare, Stripe, Sidemail.io, Crisp, Fathom Analytics, PHP Laravel (newer products)
