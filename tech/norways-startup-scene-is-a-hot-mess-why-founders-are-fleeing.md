A few years ago, Norway's startup scene was thriving. Oslo attracted grants, venture capital, and ambitious founders. Unicorns like Kahoot, Xeneta, and Oda demonstrated significant potential. However, founder John Rush documented the decline, arguing that circumstances have deteriorated substantially.

Initial challenges included COVID-19 slowdown and rising interest rates. The government then implemented aggressive tax policies that made startup development extremely difficult.

The most controversial policy involves a wealth tax targeting unrealized gains. Founders face taxation on their startup's theoretical value, despite having no actual cash from those gains. Early-stage entrepreneurs -- equity-rich but cash-poor -- suffer disproportionately.

Founder Lasse Smedsvig reported receiving a $100K annual tax bill despite taking no salary. Forced asset sales became necessary. Fredrik Haga, who helped build an early Norwegian unicorn, departed for Switzerland after confronting unrealized gains taxation.

Over 100 wealthy individuals managing $50-60 billion in assets have already relocated. The wealth tax, intended to generate $146 million annually, actually cost $400-500 million yearly through lost talent and capital flight.

The government responded with a 37.8% exit tax. A "wall of shame" featuring departed entrepreneurs further alienated the founder community.

Founder Axel Hunter relocated to Spain, noting "Norway isn't built for people like me, it's a place to settle down into a job, build a pension and retire."

**Revenue Numbers Mentioned:**
- $146 million (intended annual tax revenue)
- $400-500 million (actual annual economic loss)
- $50-60 billion (assets held by 100+ relocated individuals)
- $100K+ (individual tax bill example)
- 37.8% (exit tax rate)

**Key Lessons:**
1. Tax policy directly impacts entrepreneurial migration
2. Unrealized gains taxation proves counterproductive through capital flight
3. Ecosystem reputation damage undermines long-term competitiveness
4. Successful ecosystems prioritize builder-friendly policies
