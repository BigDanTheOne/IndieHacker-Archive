Every six months, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) ranks the top 50 AI-first web products by unique monthly visitors and the top 50 AI-first mobile apps by monthly active users.

## Creative Tools Domination

52% of top web apps focus on content generation or editing, while 58% of new entrants operate in the creative tool space. The music generator Suno achieved the highest ranking climb, jumping from #36 to #5. Video tools showed stronger growth momentum than image tools. Content editing apps comprise 22% of the mobile list.

## Emerging Categories

Aesthetics and dating represent the sole new category across both platforms. Apps like LooksMaxAI and Umax provide appearance improvement tips, while Rizz assists with dating app conversations. This aligns with the expanding "$1.5 trillion wellness industry."

## Discord's Strategic Role

Discord traffic functions as a leading indicator for ranking climbs. Developers use Discord to beta-test products and cultivate communities before standalone launches. Midjourney exemplifies this approach, building a "$10B+ business purely on Discord" with its 200 million active monthly users.

## Revenue Numbers

- Discord: 200 million monthly active users
- Wellness industry: $1.5 trillion market
- Midjourney valuation: $10B+

## Key Lessons

1. Creative content tools represent the highest-growth opportunity in AI consumer apps
2. Video generation tools show more promise than mature image generation markets
3. Discord serves as an essential launch platform for AI products
4. New consumer categories continue emerging, particularly in wellness
