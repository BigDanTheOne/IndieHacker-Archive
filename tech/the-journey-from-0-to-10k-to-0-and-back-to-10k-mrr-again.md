Timo, a German founder living in Bangkok, shares his entrepreneurial journey spanning multiple ventures. After completing a business and economics degree, he immediately launched an e-commerce agency that scaled to over $55k monthly revenue with eight employees. However, lacking recurring revenue and burdened by monthly payroll anxiety, he exited after two years.

Three days following ChatGPT's launch, a friend pitched an AI WhatsApp chatbot concept. Timo created "Jinni AI," filming a six-second TikTok at an airport that eventually accumulated hundreds of thousands of views, driving substantial traffic.

Recognizing Jinni's limitations—no moat as a basic ChatGPT wrapper—Timo explored opportunities within the WhatsApp AI space. Inspired by cold-calling experience, he conceptualized Setter AI for appointment scheduling. A simple Webflow landing page generated over 30 demo calls purely through SEO. He secured a $500 commitment from an interested prospect with zero existing product.

Setter AI initially automated phone calls but pivoted to text-based (WhatsApp/SMS) appointment setting after discovering critical flaws: only 15-20% pickup rates for unknown callers, unreliable technology, and high churn. This pivot caused the business to collapse from $10k MRR back to zero. By listening to customer feedback and pivoting toward text-based solutions, Timo eventually rebuilt to $10k+ MRR.

**Revenue generation emphasizes two inbound channels:**
- SEO: Leveraging existing high-DR sites with strategic backlinks to push Webflow landing pages to Google's first page
- YouTube: Long-form educational content drives high-intent traffic

**Revenue Numbers:**
- E-commerce agency: $55k monthly at peak
- Setter AI initial: $10k MRR
- Setter AI after collapse: $0
- Setter AI current: $10k+ MRR
- Pricing: $49-$5,000 monthly depending on plans

**Key Lessons:**
- Validate before building: Secure payment commitments before investing engineering time
- Listen to market signals: When technology fails, pivot is essential
- Recurring revenue beats project work
- High-ticket pricing early: Establish substantial per-customer value
- Leverage existing assets: Domain authority accelerates SEO rankings
- Content compounds: SEO and YouTube create sustainable inbound channels
- Resilience matters: Rebuilding after total collapse demonstrates founder perseverance

**Tech Stack:**
Supabase, OpenAI, Stripe, TypeScript, Svelte, Webflow (landing pages)
