Elliot Boucher began coding at age 10 and built a six-figure e-commerce business by 18. Seeking something more meaningful and sustainable, he co-founded Edusign, a student experience platform addressing attendance tracking challenges in higher education institutions.

**Problem Discovery & Early Strategy**
The original pain point was simple: students and teachers signed paper attendance sheets twice daily. Boucher conducted extensive user interviews—over 100 conversations—to understand the deeper issues. He discovered schools valued funding assurance more than digitization, with time-saving becoming the primary value proposition.

Boucher invested heavily in SEO optimization, leveraging competitive weaknesses in his vertical. This generated 20+ leads daily within weeks. The critical challenge became matching product development with sales momentum.

**Early Execution Advantages**
Superior user experience and exceptional support became differentiators. Boucher personally handled customer interactions, working 14+ hours daily initially. Despite numerous bugs, users gave excellent NPS scores because the team responded humanly and transparently—an advantage unavailable to larger competitors.

**Strategic Pivots Driving Growth**
Three major revenue accelerators emerged: expanding product features (enabling account manager upsells), shifting focus toward higher education enterprises, and acquiring AppScho. Current expansion includes international presence, particularly in Latin America, Spain, Italy, and the USA.

**Marketing Channel Distribution**
- SEO: Initially 95%, declining to 40-50% as referrals increased
- Outbound: Growing from 2-5% to 20%
- Partners: 15%
- Events/Webinars: 5%
- Search advertising: 2-5%

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $500K monthly revenue ($6M ARR)
- $100K+ monthly e-commerce revenue (previous venture, age 18)
- 20+ leads per day (early stage)

**Key Lessons:**
- The small-team advantage enables faster decision-making large organizations cannot replicate
- Customer obsession over perfection: Users forgave imperfections when founders showed authentic care
- Do things that don't scale: Personal involvement compounds customer loyalty and PMF
- Focus before expansion: Adding product lines at $1M ARR proved premature
- Hire more senior talent faster once resources allow

**Tech Stack:**
Node.js with TypeScript, MySQL, PostgreSQL (analytics), Angular, Ionic (mobile), Anthropic AI, GitHub, AWS (CloudFront, CloudWatch, Elastic)
