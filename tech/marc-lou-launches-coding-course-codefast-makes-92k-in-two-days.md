Marc Lou, creator of the SaaS boilerplate ShipFast, launched CodeFast on November 28th, a coding course promising to teach complete beginners how to build a SaaS in two weeks. The course includes 12 hours of video instruction covering React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Stripe/Lemon Squeezy, and email services. Students learn to build a YouTube clone and subscription-based SaaS application. Priced at $149-$299 with a Black Friday 50% discount, CodeFast generated $92,000 in revenue within 48 hours of launch.

Despite skepticism from programming educators questioning the feasibility of learning to code in two weeks, the course proved commercially successful. This launch arrives as ShipFast's revenue declined from $126,500 (March) to $27,900 (November), following security controversy.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $92,000 in two days
- ShipFast March revenue: $126,500
- ShipFast November revenue: $27,900

"A strong reputation and large following can very quickly make you a lot of money" through product launches.

- Frontend: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, daisyUI
- Backend: Next.js API, Stripe/Lemon Squeezy, Resend, MongoDB
