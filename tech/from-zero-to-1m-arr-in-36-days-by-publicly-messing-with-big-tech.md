## Full Article

Roy Lee, a Columbia University computer science sophomore, created Interview Coder -- an AI-powered assistant enabling candidates to pass technical interviews undetected. Launched via controversial marketing stunts, the product achieved rapid traction despite facing bans from LinkedIn and Reddit, finding success on X (Twitter).

The founder built the initial product leveraging his own interview experiences at Meta, Capital One, and TikTok. Success generated 50M+ views through viral content, though it resulted in blacklisting from major tech companies and disciplinary action from his university.

Lee plans scaling to $10M ARR and intends hiring additional growth and engineering support.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Electron, React
- **Backend:** Serverless edge functions (Vercel)
- **API:** OpenAI API
- **Hosting:** Vercel (experienced early DDOS costing ~$2K)
- **Development time:** Core product built in 4 days; UX refinement and paywall/authentication took approximately one month

## Key Lessons

Roy identifies two guiding principles:

1. "Distribution is king"
2. "Nothing is as risky as it seems"

He emphasizes: "All your focus should be on going viral, in my opinion. Once your product works, nothing is more important than a wide top of funnel."

Additional advice includes considering virality potential during the ideation phase itself.
