Alex Turnbull grew Groove, a help desk SaaS, to $5M ARR. Now he's building Helply with an audacious goal of $10M ARR. He previously had a startup exit at $15M.

## Revenue Numbers

- Groove: $5M ARR
- Helply: $0 current ARR with goal of $10M ARR
- Previous startup exit: $15M

## Key Lessons

1. **Bootstrapping Focus:** Emphasizes profit-driven models prioritizing EBITDA over growth, maintaining "scrappy" operations despite seven-figure annual revenue.
2. **Founder-Led Marketing:** Groove grew largely through transparent blogging and community building rather than paid channels.
3. **Process Over Capital:** Lean teams using structured frameworks like EOS can compete against well-funded competitors through aligned execution.
4. **Combating Imposter Syndrome:** Implement "proof of work" -- research, customer interviews, and data validation to overcome self-doubt.
5. **Work-Life Integration:** Sustainable success means hustling intensely within defined boundaries (4.5 days weekly for Turnbull).

**Tech Stack:** Clay (outbound enrichment), Instantly (outreach automation), RB2B (visitor identification), Smartlead (email outreach), EOS framework
