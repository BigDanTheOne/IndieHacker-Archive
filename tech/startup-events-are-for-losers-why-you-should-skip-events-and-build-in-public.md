The article opens with Peter Thiel's famous 2014 observation that the next Zuckerberg would never attend a startup event. Serial founder Pieter Levels recently sparked debate on X by declaring that "Startup events are for losers."

## The Problem with Startup Events

Startup events suffer from low barriers to entry. Because they're often free or easily accessible, attendees include many "wantrepreneurs" -- people who discuss startups without actually building anything. As investor Khushi noted, many attendees are engineers from legacy companies or VCs attempting to extract information rather than contributors with genuine startup experience.

Levels characterizes event attendees as "ecosystem leeches" who talk about building rather than actually building. He warns that this "yapping" is contagious and can distract genuine founders from their work.

## The Alternative: Building in Public

Rather than attending events, the article advocates for building in public on platforms like X, Indie Hackers, TikTok, and LinkedIn. This approach reaches far more potential connections than physical events while demonstrating actual progress.

Levels explains that successful builders naturally attract other builders online: "If you build cool shit and talk about it on here You'll start seeing very cool people in your DMs who will invite you to chat groups." He emphasizes this creates a genuine meritocracy where "people who build like to meet other people who build regardless of your scale."

## Nuanced Perspective

The article acknowledges that some events have value -- particularly those with filtering mechanisms like ticket prices, invitation requirements, or specific themes focused on builders rather than aspiring entrepreneurs.

## Key Lessons

1. Time spent shipping features generates better ROI than random networking
2. Social media enables vastly larger audience reach than physical events
3. Building publicly attracts genuine connections organically
4. Quality filtering separates valuable events from time-wasting gatherings
5. Demonstrated progress and actual building attract like-minded founders
