Rox Codes spent over five years building tools for creators. After studying computer science, he attempted restaurant startups that failed. He relocated to Thailand as a digital nomad and became a full-time Twitch streamer, building streamer-focused tools—another unsuccessful venture.

He then created ThumbnailTest.com for YouTubers, which attracted the MrBeast team's attention. He worked with them briefly before exiting the company while it generated five-figure monthly recurring revenue. This sale occurred four months before YouTube launched a competing product.

Following this, Steven Bartlett from The Diary of a CEO proposed a partnership. After experimenting with various concepts, they developed Flightcast—a video-first podcast hosting platform. The official launch happened in October 2025, employing a flat SaaS subscription model plus a small advertising revenue share. Revenue already exceeds ThumbnailTest's peak performance.

**Dead Simple But Awesome**

After years in the creator space, Codes identified a genuine gap: while numerous "creator tools" exist, few offer truly distinct functionality beyond AI integration. He wanted building something straightforward—utilizing AI selectively rather than as the core feature.

Video podcasting presented an appealing challenge: large file sizes, multiple uploads, and analytics scattered across platforms created genuine friction. The goal was crafting something "dead simple but awesome."

**Lots of Iterations**

Flightcast runs on NextJS, Cloudflare, a Go backend for media processing, and OVH servers. The team eventually migrated to Planetscale for database management.

Development required substantial iteration due to API complexity and repeated data architecture redesigns. Enabling five simultaneous posts proved surprisingly difficult to implement.

In retrospect, Codes suggests limiting v1.0 to a single outstanding feature—likely analytics—before adding publishing complexity. Even maintaining expanded v1 features, completing them sequentially rather than simultaneously would have accelerated development.

**Being a CEO**

This represents Codes' first CEO experience. The transition from pure engineering work challenges him. Locking into deep work becomes difficult without coding marathons, and measuring productivity requires embracing less tangible contributions.

Managing a team proved complex. With seed funding obtained for the first time, he hired individuals exceeding his expertise. Having worked solo previously, team management and collaborative product building from scratch posed considerable difficulties, especially since he possessed most institutional context.

**Prefilled Distribution**

After prolonged distribution struggles, Codes realized the creator ecosystem required a partner with appropriate audience and perspective. Bartlett's involvement essentially pre-loaded distribution channels.

Recommendation: "Partner with a creator. If you find the right one, it'll be the best decision you ever make."

The LinkedIn and podcast industry outlet launch proved massive. The entire Flight team posted simultaneously—their networks concentrate podcast professionals. This generated millions of impressions and hundreds of paying customers within 24 hours.

**Care More Than Anyone Else**

Actionable approach:
1. Identify groups earning decent money lacking widespread recognition
2. Determine their current tooling
3. Replace one thing—make the inaugural build a single excellent feature

The core advice: "Just care way more about one small problem than anyone else has."

**Revenue Numbers:**
- ThumbnailTest: Five-figure MRR at exit
- Flightcast: Revenue already surpasses ThumbnailTest's previous peak
- Launch impact: Hundreds of paying customers within 24 hours

**Key Lessons:**
- Distribution > Features: Partnering with established creators provides "prefilled distribution"
- Single Feature Focus: Launch with one exceptional feature rather than multiple mediocre features
- High-Quality Anchor: Using a demanding customer as a quality benchmark ensures product excellence
- CEO Mindset Shift: Moving from engineering to leadership requires accepting less tangible productivity measures
- Peer Mentorship: Learning from founders one-to-two stages ahead accelerates problem-solving

**Tech Stack:**
Next.js, Cloudflare, Go (media processing), OVH servers, Planetscale
