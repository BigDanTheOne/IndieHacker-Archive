AI has officially taken over LinkedIn. The Dead Internet Theory is here.

Since ChatGPT launched there has been an increase in AI-generated posts on LinkedIn. In October 2024 more than half of long-form posts on LinkedIn were likely AI-generated. Post length has also increased since ChatGPT launched.

According to research by Jonathan Gillham from Originality AI, "over 50% of LinkedIn's long-form posts are now AI-generated." Originality AI analyzed 8,795 LinkedIn long-form posts (100+ words) using their AI detector over the last four years.

Things exploded when ChatGPT launched in December 2022. From January to February 2023, AI-written posts jumped by a staggering 189%. Fast forward to October 2024, 54% of long-form posts are now likely written by AI.

Post length has also increased significantly. Since ChatGPT launched, LinkedIn posts have grown 107% longer on average.

AI isn't limited to posts -- it's also appearing in comments, making LinkedIn feel like bots conversing with other bots.

Some people openly promote this trend. Ruben Hassid, founder of EasyGen (an AI tool for LinkedIn), has shared impressive metrics: "I built it as my personal AI, my own ghostwriter. In 2 years, I went from 8,000 to 400,000 followers." His tool has 27,000 users, with competitors like Taplio also gaining traction.

**Key Lessons:**
1. AI adoption on professional networks accelerates rapidly following tool availability
2. Volume and length metrics alone don't indicate content quality or authenticity
3. Platform incentives (LinkedIn promoting AI writing tools) accelerate AI adoption
4. Distinguishing authentic from generated content becomes an essential skill
5. Professional networks face credibility challenges as automation increases

**Tech Stack/Tools Mentioned:**
- ChatGPT
- Originality AI (AI detection tool)
- EasyGen (LinkedIn AI writing tool)
- Taplio (LinkedIn automation competitor)
