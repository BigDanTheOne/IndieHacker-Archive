Pieter Levels, an indie hacking legend and podcast personality, influenced economist and former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi's report on European competitiveness by being tapped as an expert for guidance.

Levels's suggestions that made it into the final report include: establishing a minimum revenue threshold for regulations, creating an EU-wide business incorporation form, simplifying online EU business startup processes, offering 0% corporate tax for new businesses' first three years, viewing tech and AI positively, and incorporating tech and coding education in schools.

The article notes this represents a significant "vibe shift" in Europe, where leaders increasingly recognize competitive gaps. However, the proposals remain at the report stage rather than implemented policy.

## Key Lessons

- Successful individuals can influence policy through persistent advocacy
- Regulatory burden disproportionately impacts startups versus established companies
- Public messaging amplifies influence on policymakers
