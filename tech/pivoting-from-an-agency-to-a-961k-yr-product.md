Chris Badgett transitioned from running sled dog tours in Alaska to building LifterLMS, a WordPress-based learning management system. Initially, he operated an agency focused on LMS implementations, then recognized a market gap and pivoted to product.

The company was bootstrapped throughout. Badgett assigned one agency developer to build the MVP in 60 days. Rather than abandoning the agency immediately, he maintained it simultaneously while transitioning.

Pre-launch strategy involved offering early adopter discounts on a landing page with a set launch date, driven through content marketing and social media. This generated 42 sales in the first week.

LifterLMS employs freemium product-led growth—a powerful free core plugin with premium features behind a paywall. Approximately 30% of free users upgrade to premium plans.

Growth levers include extensive content marketing: a blog, 500+ episode podcast called LMScast, and 1,000+ YouTube videos. A free quickstart course teaches the essential 5% of features needed.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $80,000 per month
- $961,000 annual revenue
- $6,000,000+ total cumulative revenue from premium add-ons
- 42 first-week presales

**Key Lessons:**
- Preselling validates demand: Generous early adopter discount with preset launch date
- Content compounds growth: Blog, podcast, YouTube as most powerful assets
- "Don't treat support as a cost center. Treat support as a feature of the product"
- Freemium drives upgrades: 30% conversion from free to premium
- Hybrid transition reduces risk: Running agency while building product minimizes financial pressure
- Build in ecosystems: WordPress powers 43% of websites globally, providing inherent distribution

**Tech Stack:**
WordPress, PHP, JavaScript, React, REST APIs, MySQL
