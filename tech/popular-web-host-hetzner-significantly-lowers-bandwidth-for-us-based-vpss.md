Hetzner, a popular web hosting provider, has reduced bandwidth allocations for US-based Virtual Private Servers while raising rates. Users across Hacker News and social media platforms complained about the changes, with included bandwidth dropping from 20TB to as low as 1-2TB per server tier.

The author suggests the most probable cause is that Hetzner's competitively-priced offerings were generating unsustainable losses for the company.

One notable complaint cited: "20TB to 1TB is a huge change for people that may have chosen them for their previously generous tiers."

**Key Lessons:**
- Aggressive pricing strategies designed to attract customers may become financially untenable
- Market leaders can face pressure to adjust offerings when loss-leader models prove unsustainable
- Users prioritizing value may face sudden service modifications
