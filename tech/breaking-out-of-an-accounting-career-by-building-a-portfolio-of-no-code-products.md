Kieran Ball transitioned from accounting to entrepreneurship after struggling with traditional employment and failed coding attempts. He discovered no-code tools, specifically Bubble.io, and built multiple products including landing page builder Yep.so and SaaS boilerplate Bullet Launch. Success came through consistent content creation across X and email, treating distribution as primary business focus. His philosophy emphasizes long-term thinking, rapid iteration cycles, and audience-first marketing strategies.

## Revenue Numbers

- Current: >$5,000/month from no-code ventures
- Bullet Launch: $3,300/month average (after marketplace fees)
- Course sales: ~$2,000/month
- Freelancing: 10 hours/week
- Yep.so (sold product): Grew to $700 MRR, sold for $25,000
- Yep.so: Subsequently resold by buyer

## Key Lessons

1. **Distribution Over Building:** "Distribution is everything" - focus on marketing skills as critically as product development
2. **Long-Term Persistence:** The journey requires optimizing for sustainability across years, not rapid burnout cycles
3. **Attempt Velocity Matters:** Success depends on the number of iterations attempted, not just total time invested
4. **Niche Advantages:** No-code boilerplates serve underserved markets where traditional developers are scarce
5. **Content as Foundation:** Building audience (30k X followers, 4.5k newsletter subscribers) creates distribution leverage for products

- Bubble.io (no-code app builder)
- Bullet Launch (built with Bubble)
- OpenAI, Postmark, Loops (email), Stripe, Lemonsqueezy (payments)
