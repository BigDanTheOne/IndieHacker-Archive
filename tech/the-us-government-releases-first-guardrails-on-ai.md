The United States Government has officially made artificial intelligence a national security priority. On October 24th, President Joe Biden signed the first national security memorandum outlining how the Pentagon, intelligence agencies, and other national security institutions should use and protect AI.

The 38-page order emphasizes that "the United States Government must harness powerful AI, with appropriate safeguards, to achieve national security objectives." The document focuses heavily on developing international AI governance frameworks and ensuring "the United States remains the most attractive destination for global talent and home to the world's most sophisticated computational facilities."

Key government commitments include recruiting top AI talent, investing in AI semiconductor infrastructure (including the TSMC plant in Arizona), and distributing computational resources to universities, nonprofits, and independent researchers.

The order mandates testing of frontier AI models for nuclear, cybersecurity, biosecurity, and chemical weapons risks. The Energy Department must submit annual reports on AI's nuclear risks, while the AI Safety Institute must develop benchmarks for evaluating AI capabilities and limitations.

## Key Lessons

- AI is now treated as critical national security infrastructure
- Government is actively recruiting talent and building computational capacity
- Risk assessment for frontier AI models is becoming mandatory
