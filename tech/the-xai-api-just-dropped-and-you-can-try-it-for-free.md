X's AI company has released an API for its flagship large language model Grok for the first time. The interface links up to a preview of a more efficient version of the model, roughly as powerful as the current model Grok 2, but offering faster responses.

Grok-beta generates text and code and can support custom system prompts and function calling, allowing users to connect it to external tools. Currently text-only, xAI plans to release a vision version that can interpret images next week. Embedding models also appear to be on the horizon, as there's already a section for them in the API platform.

All users receive $25 monthly in free credit until year-end to test the API. To access it, developers need an xAI account at console.x.ai. Grok-beta has a context length of 128,000 tokens, with text inputs costing $5 per million tokens and chat completions at $15 per million tokens.

The pricing exceeds OpenAI's API rates (GPT-4o: $2.50/$10.00) and compares favorably to Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet ($3/$15). The API is compatible with existing OpenAI and Anthropic SDKs for easier migration.

Grok was created following Elon Musk's April 2023 announcement of a "truth-seeking" AI model, launching as a preview to Premium X users before general availability in March.

**Key Lessons:**
- Free trial credits accelerate developer adoption
- API pricing competitiveness matters for market positioning
- SDK compatibility reduces switching costs

**Tech Stack Mentioned:**
- Grok-beta LLM
- OpenAI/Anthropic compatible SDKs
