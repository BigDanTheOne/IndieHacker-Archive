Shawn Rubel founded Vecteezy, a visual content marketplace offering affordable graphics, stock photos, and video footage. The platform serves brands, creators, and storytellers globally and receives approximately 20 million monthly visitors.

Rubel started with a $40,000/year salary when he founded the company. An accidental Digg submission triggered viral growth over a weekend, generating tens of thousands of bookmarks and links that established strong search rankings still benefiting the platform today.

Early on, Rubel spent seven years building side projects instead of doubling down on what showed traction, acknowledging this as a major strategic mistake that cost significant growth potential. An executive at a major stock photo agency accused him of stealing graphics and giving them away for free--he later realized it was actually a massive green flag validating market disruption.

Revenue evolved from purely advertising-based (Google Ads) to a subscription-primary model growing 40% year-over-year. The marketplace model gives contributors a 50% revenue split based on usage. Advertising now represents less than 30% of total revenue.

The team conducts extensive A/B testing on pricing, design, churn rates, and customer cohorts. Rubel implemented "Scaling Up: Mastering the Rockefeller Habits 2.0" with quarterly coaching to structure team growth. The company is fully bootstrapped with the founder and CTO Adam Gamble owning 100%.

Rubel received and declined an acquisition offer from Envato in 2020. He emphasizes: "Hiring good help is a superpower...The moment I realized I could spend money to hire experts who were 100x better at doing things than I could, the business took off."

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $20 million annual revenue run rate
- $1.67 million monthly revenue
- ~20 million monthly visitors
- Subscriptions growing 40% year-over-year
- Advertising: less than 30% of total revenue

**Key Lessons:**
- "Hiring good help is a superpower" -- hire experts who are 100x better at specific tasks
- Seven years building side projects instead of doubling down on traction was a major strategic mistake
- Building in isolation without validating demand with users is a critical pitfall
- Intentional simplicity in tech stack maintains uptime, developer satisfaction, and organizational agility
- A/B test everything: pricing, design, churn rates, customer cohorts

**Tech Stack:**
Ruby on Rails (backend), JavaScript, HTML, CSS, StimulusJS (frontend), Elasticsearch, FAISS (search), Python (data science)
