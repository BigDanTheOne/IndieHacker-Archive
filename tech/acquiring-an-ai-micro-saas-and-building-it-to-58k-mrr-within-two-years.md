## Full Article

Ryan Darani closed his $65K MRR SEO consultancy to join Chris Riley in scaling Cuppa, an AI-powered SaaS writing tool. Cuppa was acquired by Riley in 2023 from an indie developer. A weekend launch generated lifetime deal revenue matching acquisition costs. Nearly 2 years of growth from acquisition to current $59K MRR.

## Key Lessons

1. **Momentum Matters Most:** Darani emphasizes "the most important thing about business" is maintaining momentum through consistent daily effort, not isolated wins.
2. **Distribution Over Product:** He states "Your product is only as good as your marketing," noting most indie hackers underestimate distribution importance.
3. **Network Leverage:** Initial success leveraged combined networks; ongoing growth uses influencer partnerships and "borrowing somebody else's audience" (BOPA).
4. **Customer Feedback Focus:** Built initial roadmap directly from lifetime customer feedback.
5. **Team Challenges:** Acknowledged 15-20 developer turnovers in 2023-2024, indicating talent acquisition remains the biggest obstacle.
6. **Churn as Growth Limiting Factor:** Low entry price ($20/mo) creates pricing-based churn.
7. **Strategic Playbook:** Recommended MVP-first approach with manual outreach to 100 users for validation before scaling.
