OpenAI completed its largest acquisition to date, purchasing Jony Ive's hardware startup "io" for $6.5 billion in stock. The company already owned 23% from a 2024 collaboration and paid an additional $5 billion to gain full control.

Ive and 55 engineers are joining OpenAI, including former Apple designers Scott Cannon, Evans Hankey, and Tang Tan. Product launches are anticipated in 2026.

Sam Altman described a prototype as "the coolest piece of technology the world has ever seen," though specifics remain undisclosed. The partnership aims to create "a new family of products" beyond traditional smartphones.

The article notes previous AI hardware failures, including Humane's $699 AI Pin and Rabbit R1, contrasted with Meta's successful Ray-Ban smart glasses at $299. Apple's stock dropped 2% following the announcement. OpenAI has also hired former Meta AR executive Caitlin Kalinowski and invested $400M in robotics startup Physical Intelligence.

The central challenge: success depends on creating devices that offer clear advantages over smartphones while remaining practical and affordable for everyday use.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $6.5 billion acquisition price
- $5 billion additional payment for full control
- $2.4B valuation for Physical Intelligence
- $400M investment round in Physical Intelligence

**Key Lessons:**
- Previous AI hardware attempts (Humane AI Pin, Rabbit R1) have largely failed
- Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses at $299 represent a successful model
- Creating devices that offer clear advantages over smartphones while remaining practical is the central challenge
