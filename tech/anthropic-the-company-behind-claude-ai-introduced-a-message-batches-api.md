Anthropic announced the Message Batches API, which reduces costs by fifty percent compared to standard API calls. Developers can submit batches containing up to 10,000 queries per batch. Processing occurs within a 24-hour window, though completion often happens faster. The API is compatible with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, and Claude 3 Haiku models.

## Key Lessons

- Batch processing offers significant cost savings for API users
- Large-scale query submission (up to 10,000 per batch) is now feasible
- Asynchronous processing with predictable timelines enables flexible development workflows
