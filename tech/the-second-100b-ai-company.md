The article argues that consumer AI companies, rather than enterprise solutions, will likely produce the next $100B+ valuation company. Only one U.S. tech company (Uber) with a $100B+ market cap was founded in the last 15 years, suggesting such valuations are rare.

OpenAI is positioned as the first AI company to reach $100B status (at $157B valuation following a $6.6B funding round), with the "second" company likely emerging from consumer-focused AI applications rather than B2B enterprise tools.

Three high-opportunity consumer sectors are identified: video creation (80% of internet traffic), online shopping ($16T market growing to $75T by 2034), and gaming ($250B annual sales).

While more enterprise AI IPOs may occur, consumer outcomes historically exceed enterprise valuations -- citing Uber at 3x Snowflake's size and Airbnb at 2x. Underinvestment in consumer AI is attributed to temporary market sentiment, noting that historical technology revolutions (internet, mobile, cloud) each generated approximately 20 companies exceeding $1B in revenue.

## Revenue Numbers

- OpenAI: $3.7B (2023) to $11.6B (projected 2024); $300M monthly revenue
- Online shopping market: $16T current, $75T by 2034
- Gaming: $250B annual sales

## Key Lessons

1. Incumbents will integrate AI, but disruptive AI-native companies will capture significant value
2. Consumer tech typically generates larger exits than enterprise software
3. Out-of-favor categories often present optimal investment timing
4. Foundation model layer is stabilizing; application layer offers growth opportunities

## Tech Stack Mentioned

- OpenAI's Sora (video generation)
- Meta's Video Gen
- Adobe Firefly Video Model
- Amazon's Rufus (shopping assistant)
