The article discusses research from German Sport University analyzing 1.2 million social media posts from 100 brands. Key finding: "Rivalry transforms ordinary communication into captivating stories."

Posts mentioning rival brands generate significantly more engagement -- 196.7% more likes on average than posts without competitor mentions. Rivalry narratives work best when the competitor is well-known to your audience.

Examples include Burger King's McDonald's mention generating 9.8% more likes than KFC references. Apple's "Get a Mac" campaign exemplified successful rivalry marketing through personification and gentle mockery.

The research indicates rivalry engagement stems from classic storytelling elements -- familiar antagonists and recurring conflict -- that psychologically draw audiences. However, effectiveness requires the rival be recognizable to your target market.

## Key Lessons

1. Posts mentioning rival brands generate 196.7% more likes on average
2. Rivalry narratives work best when the competitor is well-known to your audience
3. Tone matters: light-hearted, slightly critical approaches perform better than harsh negativity
4. Praising competitors can humanize your brand and boost sales without necessarily helping competitors
5. Simple fact-based comparisons (features, pricing) are safer alternatives to mockery
