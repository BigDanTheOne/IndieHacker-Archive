Thibault (Tibo) Louis-Lucas, 33, built two companies to six-figure monthly recurring revenues and sold them together for $8 million. His current projects generate approximately $28,000 monthly, and he has decided against future sales.

## 11 Products in 11 Weeks

Between 2015-2019, Louis-Lucas attempted several startups without revenue success. In 2021, he and cofounder Tom challenged themselves to create one product weekly until achieving revenue. After ten unsuccessful products, their eleventh -- Tweet Hunter -- gained rapid traction. The key differentiator was focusing on content quality rather than scheduling features.

## Sales and Regrets

Tweet Hunter reached $300,000 MRR while Taplio achieved $600,000 MRR. The package sale yielded $2 million upfront plus performance-based earnouts totaling $8 million ($6 million realized). Louis-Lucas expresses regret about losing control of his products and managing stressful revenue milestones during a two-year earnout period.

## Current Portfolio

- revid.ai (acquired Sept 2023): $18,000 MRR -- AI video generation
- feather.so (acquired April 2024): $9,000 MRR -- Notion blog creator
- superx.so (launched June 2024): $800 MRR -- Twitter growth tools

## Revenue Numbers

- Tweet Hunter peak: $300,000 MRR
- Taplio peak: $600,000 MRR
- Combined sale: $8,000,000 ($2M upfront, $6M performance bonus)
- Current combined revenue: $28,000/month

## Key Lessons

- "The truth is you'll never know. You just have to do more and ship more."
- Focus on revenue as validation rather than vanity metrics
- Building publicly generates audiences organically
- Equity partnerships with influencers drive stronger engagement than sponsored deals
- Niche specialization and tech stack consistency accelerate development
