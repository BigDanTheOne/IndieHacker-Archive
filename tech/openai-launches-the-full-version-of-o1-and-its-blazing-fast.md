OpenAI announced the full version of its o1 model during its "12 Days of Shipmas" event. The complete model is significantly faster than the preview version and now supports image uploads. It's a reasoning model that works through problems methodically, allowing additional processing time for scientific, mathematical, and coding queries.

The full o1 delivers substantially improved performance, being "34% less likely to make mistakes than o1-preview." Testing demonstrated rapid response times -- approximately one second for simple requests and under 20 seconds for comprehensive answers.

Key improvements include stronger performance in coding, mathematics, and expert science questions. However, internet search functionality and API access remain unavailable, with OpenAI indicating these features are in development.
