Max Artemov spent eight years as an iOS developer before attempting a side project. His initial motivation was straightforward: achieve financial independence and work without a traditional 9-to-5 schedule to spend more time with family.

For over five years, he built a calorie counter app, attempting various growth strategies including expanding to Android with Flutter—all without meaningful results. The experience left him nearly burnt out. Everything changed when he discovered Adam Lyttle's YouTube video advocating for building a portfolio of apps rather than fixating on a single project.

This insight completely reoriented his approach. Instead of perfecting one application, Artemov shifted to creating multiple simple applications addressing specific user needs.

**A Shift in Mindset:**

Artemov acknowledges his traditional software engineering background hindered early progress. He over-engineered solutions, following SOLID principles and maintaining perfect architecture—practices valuable in larger teams but counterproductive for solo indie development. This approach consumed excessive time on features that didn't meaningfully impact user experience or core functionality.

The transformation involved adopting what he calls an "indie-developer mindset": construct rapidly, deploy immediately, and concentrate exclusively on essential core features. Additional features receive consideration only after observing actual usage patterns and receiving positive user validation.

**Growth Strategy via ASO and Paid Advertising:**

The primary user acquisition method involves ASO. Learning ASO fundamentals increased his metrics by approximately fifty percent across impressions, downloads, and revenue.

His ASO methodology prioritizes keyword research before development begins:
- Identify keywords demonstrating high popularity with low competition (typically popularity exceeding 20, difficulty under 60)
- Design applications specifically addressing that keyword's user need
- Incorporate the keyword into title, subtitle, and description fields
- Repeat this process systematically

**Validating Promising App Ideas:**

After release, applications typically experience initial App Store promotion lasting several days. Most subsequently decline to 10-50 weekly downloads. Applications demonstrating survival characteristics—maintaining moderate performance without sharp decline—indicate genuine potential worth pursuing.

**Key Principle:**
"Don't fear shipping." Rather than polishing excessively or contemplating additional features, developers should launch bug-free MVPs with single core functionalities while simultaneously progressing toward the next project concept.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $22,000 MRR
- Portfolio comprises 30+ applications
- Timeline: Less than one year from strategy pivot to $22k/mo

**Key Lessons:**
- "Build fast, ship fast" delivers superior results compared to perfectionism
- Portfolio diversification reduces risk; multiple small bets outperform single large bets
- Keyword validation should precede development rather than following it
- Emotional detachment from individual ideas enables faster iteration
- Distribution and market demand matter more than architectural elegance
- User feedback should guide feature expansion, not pre-launch assumptions

**Tech Stack:**
Flutter (cross-platform iOS/Android), Firebase (auth, hosting, Cloud Functions), Astro and FoxData (ASO tools), CAS and Appodeal (ad mediation)
