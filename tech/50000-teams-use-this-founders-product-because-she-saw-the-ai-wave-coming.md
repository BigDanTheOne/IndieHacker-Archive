## Full Article

Yana Welinder is the founder and CEO of Kraftful, a SaaS product that transforms how product teams manage user feedback. She also serves as a Senior Venture Partner at Pioneer Fund and a Fellow at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society, while co-founding VC-Backed Moms, a nonprofit supporting over 500 founders.

Kraftful automatically collects feedback from sources including Intercom, Zendesk, app stores, G2, and video call platforms, converting raw data into actionable feature requests, product requirement documents, and user stories that integrate with Jira or Linear.

Welinder applied to Y Combinator while working at IFTTT as Head of Product. Upon acceptance, she immediately left her position to pursue Kraftful full-time. The initial MVP was built by two engineers within months.

Growth has been entirely organic -- word of mouth through AI-knowledgeable influencers and "top AI tools" lists, founder-led personal support, building in public, and Y Combinator credibility.

## Key Lessons

1. "Start small and iterate fast. Your MVP doesn't need to be perfect; it just needs to solve one problem exceptionally well."
2. Focus on solving genuine pain points and engage extensively with users to refine the product
3. Strategic timing of technology adoption and market positioning matters significantly

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React and Blitz
- Backend: Integrated databases and APIs for continuous feedback syncing
- AI Infrastructure: OpenAI and Azure APIs with o1 and 4o models for scale and cost optimization
