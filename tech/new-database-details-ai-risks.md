As artificial intelligence experiences rapid expansion and enterprise adoption increases, apprehension about potential dangers continues to escalate. Research organization Arize AI documented that 281 Fortune 500 companies identified AI as a risk factor in their 2024 financial disclosures, representing a 473.5% increase since 2022 when only 49 companies mentioned such concerns.

A research team featuring MIT Sloan scientist Neil Thompson unveiled the AI Risk Repository, a comprehensive database cataloging more than 700 AI-related risks.

## The Repository Comprises Three Elements

1. **AI Risk Database** - Documents 777 distinct risks extracted from 43 sources
2. **Causal Taxonomy** - Organizes risks by root causes: responsible party (human/AI), intent level, and occurrence stage
3. **Domain Taxonomy** - Categorizes risks across seven domains and 23 subcategories

## Key Findings

- 51% of identified risks attributed to AI systems versus 34% to human actors
- 65% of risks emerge post-deployment versus 10% pre-deployment
- 35% intentional and 37% unintentional risks identified

## Key Lessons

1. AI dangers require unified frameworks across sectors to address fragmented discussions
2. Comprehensive risk categorization enables better oversight as deployment accelerates
3. Shared terminology between industry, government, and academia facilitates coordinated risk management
