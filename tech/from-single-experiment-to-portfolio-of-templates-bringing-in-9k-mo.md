Kazi Mohammed Erfan founded Pentaclay after noticing that design templates for Framer and Webflow lacked real-world usability. He began by learning Framer from scratch and challenged himself to get one template approved in the marketplace. That single success evolved into a systematic approach to template creation.

**Background & Motivation:**
Erfan holds a Civil and Environmental Engineering degree but became passionate about design during his studies in 2013. After working in various design roles, he identified a market gap: templates that looked polished but failed in practical application. He founded Pentaclay to create conversion-focused, structurally sound templates rather than merely aesthetically pleasing ones.

**Business Model:**
Pentaclay operates two revenue streams: selling premium Framer and Webflow templates individually or through an All-Access pass providing full library access, plus a design and development agency offering high-quality client work.

**Growth Strategy:**
Erfan emphasizes consistent, iterative submissions—currently releasing six templates monthly on Webflow and seven to eight on Framer. He identifies niche opportunities through competitor analysis and market research, targeting both high-demand and low-competition categories.

**Data-Driven Improvements:**
Tracking user behavior extensively revealed unexpected insights. Analyzing heatmaps showed users spent significant time on FAQ sections, contradicting initial assumptions. Rewriting FAQs to address specific user concerns noticeably improved conversion rates.

**Marketing & Community:**
Growth came through product quality, niche research, and strategic community engagement. Pentaclay shares work on X and Reddit, participates in design communities, and collaborates with other creators. Some posts reached 20,000-30,000 views, driving substantial template traffic.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $9,000/month from template sales
- $6,000/month from agency services
- $15,000/month combined total revenue
- Target: $20,000/month after team scaling
- Goal: $30,000+/month within 6-12 months

**Key Lessons:**
- Start with experimentation: One approved template became the foundation for systematic growth
- Consistency over perfection: Regular submissions (6-8 monthly) accelerate learning
- Data guides decisions: Heatmaps revealed FAQ sections significantly impact trust and conversions
- Niche focus matters: Research-driven niche selection enables differentiation
- Community engagement scales: Strategic visibility in design communities drove substantial traffic
- Quality and usability trump aesthetics

**Tech Stack:**
Framer, Webflow, Figma, Google Analytics, Notion, Slack, LemonSqueezy (payments)
