Timo Nikolai (26, travel influencer) and Josef Buettgen (24, software developer) co-founded SetterAI, a voice AI platform automating appointment-setting calls. Starting in February 2024, they built an MVP and acquired their first paying customer within two weeks.

## Revenue Numbers

- Current MRR: $1.8K monthly
- Average cost per booked meeting: less than $5
- Platform has executed approximately 21,000 calls total
- Customers contribute $500 refundable deposits during validation phase

## Key Lessons

1. Validate before building -- create landing pages with fake demos to test demand
2. Presales signal genuine interest better than waitlists
3. Leverage existing audiences (social media, YouTube) for growth
4. Voice AI requires ongoing customer interaction; it's "not the plug-and-play SaaS"
5. Price conservatively; founders acknowledge charging below market value
6. Don't incorporate before generating revenue

**Tech Stack:** Voice generation, text generation, and transcription APIs, Calendly, Google Calendar integrations, multilingual calling capabilities
