Replit released Replit Agent v2, an AI-powered coding assistant enabling users to describe app ideas in natural language (e.g., "create a subscription landing page") and generate working prototypes.

## Key Updates

- Real-time design preview allowing users to see apps as they're built
- Redesigned workflow for brainstorming, feature selection, and code assembly

Mobile support for Agent v2 is forthcoming, though the core Replit mobile app launched on iOS and Android last year.

## Pricing & Access

- Requires Core ($25/month) or Teams ($40/user/month) subscription
- Usage costs 25 cents per checkpoint with subscription credits offsetting expenses

## Pros & Cons

The author notes that Replit Agent v2 "speeds up prototyping, lowers entry barriers for non-coders" but acknowledges limitations including inability to import existing projects, need for extensive human oversight on complex work, and potentially accumulating subscription costs.

## Key Lessons

- AI-assisted development reduces barriers for non-technical founders
- Convenience and integration matter as much as underlying technology
- Cost considerations important for heavy users
