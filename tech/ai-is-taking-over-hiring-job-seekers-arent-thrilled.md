The piece examines AI's growing role in recruitment screening. AI interviewing tools address a genuine problem: recruiters receive applications at unsustainable volumes. The article notes that "the number of job applications is growing four times faster" than available positions, with hiring averaging 45 days.

From employers' perspectives, AI streamlines initial screening, reducing costs while potentially improving fairness. However, candidates often experience these interactions as dehumanizing and opaque. The article features Paloma Canseco, a graphic designer who abandoned an AI phone interview mid-conversation, uncomfortable with the company's automated approach.

The piece emphasizes a critical tension: AI can improve hiring efficiency but risks eroding human connection -- something indie businesses depend upon for differentiation.

**Key Lessons:**
- AI solves real recruitment problems but creates candidate anxiety
- Lack of transparency in AI decision-making undermines trust
- Balancing automation with authentic human interaction matters for company culture
- The ideal approach supports human judgment rather than replacing it

**Tech Stack Mentioned:**
- LazyApply (application automation tool)
- AI interviewing platforms (unnamed)
