Nvidia has launched NIM Agent Blueprints, a free-to-use service described as "a catalog of pre-trained, customizable workflows and software resources that make it easy to build and deploy enterprise AI agents and apps."

The initial three blueprints include a digital human for customer service, generative virtual screening for accelerated drug discovery, and multimodal PDF data extraction for enterprise RAG. Additional blueprints in development cover content generation, software engineering, retail shopping advisors, and R&D applications.

## Key Lessons

- Nvidia identified a shortage of quality AI boilerplates, particularly for AI agents
- The indie hacker community recognizes boilerplates as potentially lucrative opportunities
- Enterprise-focused solutions may create opportunities for indie developers to serve smaller markets

**Tech Stack:** NIM Agent Blueprints (Nvidia), Enterprise RAG, AI agents
