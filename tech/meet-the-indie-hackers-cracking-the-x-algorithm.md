## Key Lessons

1. **Algorithm Fundamentals:** The X algorithm ranks 1,500 posts based on predicted user interaction likelihood, with replies and profile clicks weighted 13.5x higher than likes.

2. **Content Strategy:** As one creator demonstrated, "moving links from the main tweet to a reply tweet" yielded a "270% bump in views and 486% bump in likes."

3. **Verification Requirement:** X Premium verification is described as essential for growth potential.

4. **Evolving Metas:** The algorithm cycles through trending formats roughly every 1-2 months, currently favoring visual media, conflict-driven content, and image/video-based threads over text-heavy posts.

5. **Universal Success Factor:** "The most important factor for X success is not the algorithm, but the poster" themselves -- authenticity and interesting content outlast tactical optimizations.
