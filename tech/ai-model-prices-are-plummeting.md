The article discusses two recent developments showing AI model costs are declining. Mistral launched a free tier for developers with API access, drastically reducing prices on its AI models. Meanwhile, Alibaba released over 100 open-source AI models ranging from 0.5 to 72 billion parameters supporting 29+ languages.

The author notes that "AI MVPs are getting cheaper," allowing indie founders to build AI applications without expensive OpenAI credits. Y Combinator's 2023 batch contained 35% AI startups, nearly doubling by 2024, indicating strong investor interest.

## Key Lessons

- AI infrastructure costs are becoming commoditized
- Open-source and free-tier models reduce barriers to entry for developers
- "The future of AI is open source and decentralized"
- Favorable conditions exist for indie founders launching AI products
