Cameron Trew quit his senior engineering role at a major tech company, moved back with his parents, and built Kleo—a LinkedIn content creation tool using AI. Within three months, the product reached $62k MRR. His cofounder Jake Ward had 180k+ LinkedIn followers; cofounder Lara Acosta had 300k+. Their previous product, Kleo 1.0, was a free Chrome extension with 60k users before receiving a cease-and-desist from LinkedIn.

Trew rebuilt the product from scratch in four weeks using Next.js, TypeScript, and Claude AI. The team sold 500 lifetime discount spots ($59/month) in four days, then another 500 spots ($79/month) in nine days. Standard pricing became $99/month.

The distribution strategy relied on founders' existing audiences rather than paid ads or Product Hunt. Lara conducted three pre-launch webinars generating $5k+ each. The team shared behind-the-scenes updates on LinkedIn and maintained a private Slack community for beta users. When bugs were reported, Trew fixed them within hours and notified users personally.

The team prioritized ruthlessly: bugs first, then revenue-generating features, then user-requested additions. Users struggled with the identity section, so the team simplified it. When voice input was requested, they integrated Deepgram. Claude Memory was added to automatically learn users' writing preferences over time.

Trew emphasizes that AI code editors transformed his productivity. After ten years of traditional coding, combining deep experience with Claude Code enabled solo development at previously impossible speeds.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $62k MRR for Kleo in three months
- $82k total monthly revenue (Kleo + Mentions combined)
- Mentions (second product) at $20k MRR
- 500 lifetime spots sold at $59/month in four days
- Next 500 spots at $79/month in nine days
- Standard pricing: $99/month
- Three webinars generating $5k+ each
- Goal for 2026: 5x Kleo to $300k MRR and Mentions to $100k MRR

**Key Lessons:**
- "Distribution first. The best product in the world means nothing if no one knows it exists."
- "Build something you actually use. We built Kleo for ourselves."
- "Ship fast, then listen. We had a working version in 4 weeks."
- "Learn AI tools. If you're not using AI to code, you're leaving speed on table."
- "Keep prioritization stupid simple. One list. Work top to bottom."
- "Don't over-engineer. Pick tools that let you move fast."
- Trust scales faster than traffic; transparency builds customer loyalty
