The piece highlights recent security threats targeting developers. The author notes that "more than 35 big Chrome extensions spread malware to millions of users" due to developer phishing vulnerabilities. Similar concerns exist on GitHub, where malicious repositories inflate popularity through fraudulent stars.

## Key Statistics

- 4.5 million fraudulent stars discovered on GitHub

## Key Lessons

1. Double-check GitHub repositories before integration
2. Verify repository legitimacy and contributor trustworthiness
3. Be cautious of sudden popularity spikes or suspicious activity
4. Enable two-factor authentication on development accounts
5. Use vulnerability scanning tools (Snyk, Dependabot mentioned in comments)
6. Validate DNS names and email addresses carefully

## Tech Stack/Tools Mentioned

- Chrome extensions
- GitHub repositories
- Snyk (vulnerability scanner)
- Dependabot (dependency security tool)
