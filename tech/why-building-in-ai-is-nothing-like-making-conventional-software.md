Building AI products requires fundamentally different approaches than conventional software development due to unique risk profiles and unpredictable model behavior.

**Core Framework - Three Risk Types:**
1. **Feasibility Risk:** Can it be built?
2. **Value Risk:** Will users extract value?
3. **Viability Risk:** Can the business monetize it?

**Critical Distinction:**
Traditional software exhibits low feasibility risk but higher value/viability challenges. AI introduces a middle ground -- "feasible but unpredictable."

**Key Lessons:**
- AI models produce stochastic (non-deterministic) outputs requiring continuous testing
- Applied AI startups should validate model quality *before* building UI/UX layers
- Deep AI vs. Applied AI startups face different primary risks
- Iterative "tuning" of prompts and parameters is essential, not optional
- User acquisition and retention present growing challenges for new AI ventures

**Tech Stack Mentioned:**
- GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama 3.2

**Project Reference:**
Mindtune -- an AI-driven personalized content alternative to traditional social media algorithms
