OpenAI released three new API models: GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano, targeting developers with improvements in coding, instruction following, and extended context handling.

These models serve as alternatives to Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. The models are API-exclusive; they cannot be accessed through standard ChatGPT. Major code editors (Cursor, Windsurf, Microsoft Copilot) offered temporary free access.

Pricing is more competitive than Claude and Gemini offerings when accounting for caching discounts. However, performance benchmarks show GPT-4.1 lags behind competitors on reasoning (GPQA Diamond), coding (SWE-bench), mathematics (AIME 2024), and multimodal tasks (MMMU).

GPT-4.5 Preview will deprecate July 14, 2025, with three months for developers to transition.

**Key Lessons:**
- OpenAI prioritizes cost-efficiency and developer accessibility
- Performance trails leading competitors on complex reasoning tasks
- API-exclusive models target developer workflows rather than consumer chatbot use
- Major code editors offered temporary free access to drive adoption
