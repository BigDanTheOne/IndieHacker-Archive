Sander Visser launched Checkout Page six years ago as a side project. The platform initially provided a no-code way to accept Stripe payments. Andy Nelson, a former product manager, later joined and together they transformed it into a comprehensive payment solution supporting subscriptions and event ticketing.

## Revenue Numbers

- Current MRR: $13,000
- Time to $1,000 MRR: ~3 years
- Monthly payment processing: $1.5 million
- Current customers: ~250

## Key Lessons

1. **Patience matters:** "People underestimate how long it takes to get to revenue and to profitability."
2. **Customer engagement drives growth:** Switching to a more approachable chat interface dramatically increased conversations and product feedback.
3. **Simplify pricing:** Complex models confused customers; straightforward subscriptions clarified value propositions.
4. **Collaboration beats isolation:** "No big company has ever been built by a person on their own."
5. **Revenue takes time:** "Time in the market is an important asset."
6. **Flexible product design:** Offering customizable features increased adoption.

**Tech Stack:** JavaScript, Node.js, React, Next.js, WordPress (integration), Crisp (chat client)
