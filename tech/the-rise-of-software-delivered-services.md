The article proposes a new business model called Software-Delivered Services (SDS), distinguishing it from traditional SaaS. Rather than selling tools, SDS companies "sell work, not workflow" and "sell outcomes, not tools."

## Becoming Accountable

SDS firms face heightened responsibility compared to SaaS predecessors. When service quality fails, the provider bears responsibility rather than the user. This demands elevated quality assurance structures, potentially rebranded as "Eval teams."

## The Billing Dilemma

Traditional per-seat pricing doesn't fit SDS models. Instead, companies increasingly adopt usage-based or piece-work billing -- charging per unit of value delivered, mirroring professional services billing approaches.

## Navigating the New Frontier

SDS companies compete against professional services by offering similar outcomes at significantly reduced costs, though they must build substantial customer-facing teams to address gaps in AI capabilities.

## Examples

- Sierra (customer service, per-closed-ticket billing)
- Lighthouse (visa services for technologists)
- Crescendo (AI-powered call centers)
- Micro1 (AI-driven candidate screening)
- Exec.com (AI sales training)

## Key Lessons

- Quality accountability is paramount and becomes a competitive advantage
- Billing models must align with value delivery rather than user seats
- Successful SDS firms embody "full-stack startup" principles with robust customer-facing operations

**Tech Stack:** Multi-modal AI models, LLMs
