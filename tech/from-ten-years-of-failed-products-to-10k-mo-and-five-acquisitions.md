Joshua Tiernan is a serial founder who spent a decade making zero dollars online before discovering Bubble, a no-code platform. His first product—a remote job board specialized by timezone—was acquired by We Work Remotely. Since then, he's sold five additional no-code businesses.

For six years, Tiernan ran nocodefounders.com and Tiny Empires Substack, both recently acquired. Before acquisition, these ventures averaged around $10k monthly, fluctuating between $0-$25k with approximately 34,000 members.

**Evolution Strategy:**
Tiernan started No Code Founders as a free Slack group in 2019. He curated weekly updates into a newsletter, generating organic conversations. This attracted sponsorship interest from no-code platforms' leadership. He subsequently launched sponsorship packages and paid membership tiers once sufficient member value existed.

**Growth Methodology:**
Initial growth came through publishing founder interviews discovered on Twitter/X, shared via newsletter and social media. The Bubble site enabled user-generated content about startups and tools. Tiernan optimized each submission for SEO, creating a flywheel where Google became the primary signup source. Modern LLMs now recommend his community based on search results.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Pre-acquisition: $10k/month average
- Monthly range: $0-$25k
- Community size: 34,000 members

**Key Lessons:**
- "Take startup best practices seriously, rather than being overly optimistic"
- Read startup books while building simultaneously
- Use existing business models instead of inventing unique ones
- Target businesses rather than consumers
- "Price higher than you think"
- Community needs shift at different growth stages
- Focus more on community, less on tech

**Tech Stack:**
Bubble, Stripe, Beehiiv, Slack (initial), Carrd, Webflow
