Vedran Rasic's family lost their savings in a post-war Yugoslav bank crash. A decade later, they recovered 600 EUR—enough for his first computer. This sparked a journey through multiple ventures: student organization sales, digital asset management, a digital studio, and two SaaS companies.

His first SaaS, MyShop (2017), failed. His second, Autoklose (2018), succeeded and was acquired in 2020, allowing him to purchase his first home and build savings. Now based in San Francisco, he's building LeadDelta, launched in 2022, approaching seven-figure annual recurring revenue with a small, profitable team.

**Finding the Idea**

The LeadDelta concept crystallized around a simple insight: professional networks determine success in fundraising, sales, and marketing. The platform helps users synchronize contacts into a unified hub with intelligence layers, enabling warm introductions instead of cold outreach.

**Starting Small**

Rather than raising substantial capital, Rasic prioritized rapid de-risking. He acquired a small product for several thousand dollars, spent one month refactoring it, and launched with 500+ landing page subscribers within weeks.

The initial offering was elegantly simple: a LinkedIn contact manager featuring one table with tags and notes. While competitors focused on automation and scraping, LeadDelta positioned itself as a relationship manager.

**Organic Growth Stages**

- **0-10K Users:** Leveraged personal network, requested reviews from satisfied users, optimized SEO early, built community through AppSumo, Product Hunt, and Indie Hackers.
- **10-20K Users:** Weekly feature releases maintained momentum. Achieved Product of the Day three consecutive times, then Product of the Year in January 2023.
- **20-35K Users:** Focused intensively on content, SEO, and partnerships. Maintained approximately 500-600 affiliates, though only 10-50 generate significant revenue.

**B2C2B Model**

LeadDelta employs a B2C2B approach with a free seven-day no-credit-card trial. Individual adoption leads to team expansion—users invite colleagues and community members to shared workspaces, share networks, and purchase enrichment credits.

**Pricing Strategy**

Rasic changes pricing every three to six months, conducting regular testing. Recent pricing increases tripled costs; customers still report the new pricing as reasonable.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Current: ~$80,000 MRR (approximately $960,000 ARR)
- Target: Seven-figure ARR (imminent)
- Growth Rate: 100% YoY targeted while maintaining profitability
- Team Size: 9 people, fully remote
- Previous Exit (Autoklose): Acquired in 2020

**Key Lessons:**
- De-risk rapidly through quick market validation
- Position distinctly—focus on relationship management rather than competing on automation
- Ship relentlessly—weekly releases demonstrate ongoing investment
- Test pricing frequently—adjust every 3-6 months
- "Start lean, start ASAP" without months of pre-launch development
- Maintain daily discipline: "Am I building?" and "Am I selling?"
- Profitability and sustainability matter as much as growth metrics
