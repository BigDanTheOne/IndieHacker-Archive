Kristel Kruustuk began her career at age 22 as a freelance software tester in London, literally hanging posters around a coworking space that read "I hunt for bugs." Thirteen years later, alongside her husband Marko Kruustuk, she founded Testlio—a community-driven QA platform connecting verified testers across 150+ countries with companies ranging from Fortune 500 enterprises to smaller organizations.

The genesis of Testlio emerged from Kruustuk's frustration with existing testing platforms. "The traditional model compensated testers based on the number of bugs they found rather than time spent, creating an environment where testers wouldn't collaborate." This incentive misalignment led testers to rush reporting low-priority bugs instead of conducting thorough testing.

Testlio operates on a crowdsourced model where companies access a vetted testing community. Rather than competing on price with low-cost platforms, Testlio deliberately attracts quality-focused brands willing to pay premium rates. Testers receive regional compensation based on task complexity.

The platform integrates AI-powered test creation and management, no-code and scripted automation tools, and third-party systems via CI/CD pipelines. The system manages logistics of connecting global testers with devices and testing infrastructure.

Early growth came organically. Many early customers were former testers or QA managers who understood the platform's value proposition. The company deliberately targeted quality-conscious brands like Netflix rather than competing purely on metrics.

Recent innovation includes LeoAI Engine and LeoMatch—AI-driven tools for QA and talent matching. The company is expanding globally, particularly in Europe, Middle East, Asia, and Latin America.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- 7-figure MRR (exceeding $1 million monthly)

**Key Lessons:**
- Quality over volume: Rewarding thorough testing fundamentally changed tester behavior and outcomes
- Community as foundation: "Build and join networks, and have friends around you"
- Adaptability as competitive advantage: Early AI experimentation positioned the company ahead
- Value-driven growth: Focus on genuine value rather than competing on price
- Lean beginnings scale: Grassroots tactics proved more effective than premature scaling
- "If I had to start over, I'd lean even more into my intuition"

**Tech Stack:**
AWS, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon API Gateway, AI-powered test creation, no-code and scripted automation, CI/CD pipelines
