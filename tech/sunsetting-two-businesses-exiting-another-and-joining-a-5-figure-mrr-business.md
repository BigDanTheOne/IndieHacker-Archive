Igor Debatur began his entrepreneurial journey in 2003 as a full-stack developer, creating automation tools and content management platforms. He co-founded Whitescape, a web development agency that grew to $100K/month but lacked notable profitability.

Parallel to this venture, Debatur and a co-founder launched the RIDERS app—a community platform helping users improve skills in skiing, surfing, BMX, skateboarding, and mountain biking. The app gained significant traction with major extreme sports brand partnerships, yet remained below break-even financially.

Uploadcare, another venture, became the primary focus after Debatur realized managing three companies simultaneously created fragmentation across all operations. "I couldn't focus and any success in one company led to a failure in another." He sunset Whitescape and RIDERS to concentrate exclusively on Uploadcare.

The content management and delivery platform scaled substantially, growing from three employees to 34, with customers including Zapier, PandaDoc, Sequoia, and SoundCloud. Uploadcare achieved multi-million ARR before acquisition by Tiugo Technologies in 2024.

In early 2025, Debatur joined Outmap—a backcountry navigation application created by solo developer Felix Gourdeau since 2021—as CEO and cofounder. The app was already generating five-figure monthly recurring revenue when he joined.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Whitescape: $100K/month (agency revenue, not profit)
- Uploadcare: Multi-million ARR at acquisition
- Outmap: 5-figure MRR (>$10K/month)

**Key Lessons:**
- Focus and ego are recurring challenges: fragmented attention across ventures destroys all of them
- "Don't bring mercenaries, bring missionaries" -- seek mission-aligned team members
- Conduct 20 customer development interviews before scaling
- Choose problems where you genuinely care about solving user struggles
- Trust intuition: "You feel something is off, it usually is"

**Tech Stack:**
Next.js, React Native, Supabase, Firebase, Amplitude, Mapbox, Tally, n8n, Notion, RevenueCat
