Viktor Seraleev founded Sarafan Mobile and rebuilt his business three times after facing major setbacks. The piece documents his journey from launching initial apps to achieving over $60,000 monthly revenue.

The founder initially avoided traditional employment, starting with offline businesses before transitioning to digital products. He launched 30+ apps since 2020, primarily in photo/video and creative utility spaces.

**First Major Reset (2020):** Seraleev left partners to work independently.

**Second Reset:** Mental health required a complete business rethink despite having capital available.

**Third Reset (2022):** This proved most challenging. He relocated from Russia to Chile, losing 75% of revenue overnight. Shortly after, Apple terminated his developer account due to a naming conflict with a former partner's company. Simultaneously, sanctions caused his bank to freeze company funds. He pursued legal action but lost in court.

**Early Success:** His wife needed a before-and-after slider for manicure videos on Instagram. Seraleev built an app filling this gap. Revenue grew from $200 to $34,000 within eight months, eventually selling for $410,000.

**Portfolio Strategy:** He set a personal challenge to build 10 apps annually, focusing on high quality, genuinely useful small projects. This forced rapid iteration and learning.

**Technical Choices:** Seraleev uses Swift for video-intensive apps with proprietary rendering technology. He experimented with Kotlin Multiplatform and React Native, noting cross-platform development has improved significantly for non-video projects.

**Monetization Model:** All apps use subscription models (avoiding ads entirely). Premium features drive revenue through weekly and yearly plans. Black Friday campaigns typically increase daily revenue 30-40%.

**Growth Channels:**
- App Store Optimization generates ~25% of traffic
- Personal blog and social media reach millions
- Google Ads provide profitable scaling
- TikTok/Instagram Reels: Posting six videos daily (bilingual Spanish/English) generated views exceeding 1.2 million
- Product Hunt launches provide early feedback
- Apple Search Ads were previously main channel before account termination

**Current Status:** December 2025 generated $60,100+ in proceeds after Apple commissions.

**Future Direction:** Building diversified business across App Store, Google Play, and SaaS. Testing web products including Type.link (link-in-bio builder). Planning platform-agnostic expansion to reduce ecosystem dependency.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Initial app: $200 to $34,000 (8 months)
- $410,000 app sale price
- December 2025: $60,100+ monthly proceeds
- Black Friday campaigns: 30-40% daily revenue increases

**Key Lessons:**
- Starting over teaches patience whether you want it or not
- Single-platform dependency is dangerous; building across multiple ecosystems is survival strategy
- Portfolio approach: Small bets compound better than betting everything on one app
- Transparency matters: Building openly attracted attention including from Apple managers
- ASO, sustainable monetization, and consistent shipping outperform chasing viral moments
- Direct value-for-payment (subscriptions) over ad-based models creates cleaner user relationships

**Tech Stack:**
Swift (iOS, proprietary video rendering), Kotlin Multiplatform, React Native, App Store, Google Play
