Researchers have open sourced Sky-T1, described as a "reasoning" AI model trainable for under $450. The model demonstrates performance comparable to an earlier iteration of OpenAI's o1 across several important benchmarks. The author observes that AI models are becoming increasingly commoditized, suggesting we're entering an "implementation" era where organizations focus on deploying AI across different sectors.

## Revenue Numbers

- $450 (training cost for Sky-T1)

## Key Lessons

- AI model development costs are declining significantly
- The field is shifting from pure research toward practical implementation
- Commoditization of AI technology is democratizing access for smaller organizations and individual developers
- Cost reduction enables broader adoption across industries

## Tech Stack Mentioned

- Sky-T1 (open source reasoning AI model)
- OpenAI's o1 (comparison benchmark)
