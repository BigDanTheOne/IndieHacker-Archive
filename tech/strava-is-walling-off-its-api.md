Strava, a fitness platform with 120 million users, is restricting third-party app access to its API. The company claims the change affects fewer than 0.1% of applications, but community backlash has been significant.

Strava serves as a centralized hub for fitness data from incompatible wearables and devices. Third-party apps rely on API access to avoid integrating with thousands of individual fitness platforms. By restricting this access, Strava eliminates a key benefit for developers and users seeking consolidated fitness tracking solutions.

The decision has sparked controversy in the Strava community, with Reddit users expressing frustration. One commenter notes the move seems counterintuitive since "Strava's position as the fitness middleman was super valuable."

The article concludes with a broader warning: "this is another lesson on the dangers of building on rented land," referencing the risks developers face when depending on third-party platforms they don't control.

**Key Lessons:**
- Dependence on third-party APIs creates vulnerability for developers
- Platform restrictions can eliminate ecosystem value unexpectedly

**Tech Stack Mentioned:**
- Strava API
- Peloton bikes
- Garmin watches
