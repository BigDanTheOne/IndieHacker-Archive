Andre Casal has spent 20 years building a sustainable income through teaching computer science and developing web applications for clients. His teaching generates approximately $3,000 monthly, while client work brings in roughly $10,000 monthly, totaling his $13,000/month revenue base.

During this period, Casal continuously explored entrepreneurial opportunities while struggling with execution and marketing. He recently launched LaunchFastPro after six months of development, making six initial sales at EUR 50 each, which validated market demand.

Casal acknowledges marketing as his greatest challenge. He notes that early sales came predominantly through one-on-one demonstrations, achieving a 100% conversion rate in personal meetings. However, recognizing this approach doesn't scale, he's now investing in branding and marketing efforts.

**Key Advice Shared:**
- Build connections with values-aligned entrepreneurs
- Understand that motivation follows action, not vice versa
- Break overwhelming tasks into absurdly small steps to maintain momentum

Casal recently secured a EUR 30,000 startup voucher to accelerate development and is transitioning from sole proprietorship to an LLC structure.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $13,000/month total revenue
- $3,000/month from teaching
- $10,000/month from client work
- EUR 50 per initial sale (6 sales made)
- EUR 30,000 startup voucher awarded

**Key Lessons:**
- Building a profitable base business allows experimentation without desperation
- Engineers often struggle transitioning from building to promoting
- Direct customer conversations validate product-market fit before investing in growth infrastructure
- Twenty years of incremental improvements compound significantly over time
- Security shouldn't be an afterthought
