Building in public has long been considered essential advice for indie hackers seeking traction, early feedback, and loyal customer bases. However, growing frustration suggests this strategy's effectiveness may be waning.

Laike9m, a former Google engineer, sparked debate with a viral Hacker News post titled "No One Builds In Public." The core argument: indie hacking's saturation has eroded the competitive advantage that made building in public valuable a decade ago. When legends like Pieter Levels pioneered this approach, standing out was achievable. Today's landscape is different -- dominated by repetitive "look at my MRR" posts that lack substance.

Laike's key observation: "When everyone builds in public, no one builds in public."

Most Hacker News commenters agreed, with the highest-rated response noting that builders often become trapped, ultimately creating products primarily for other indie hackers rather than reaching broader markets.

Survey responses from indie hackers revealed mixed sentiments. Some reported success, like Said Aitmbarek, who noted social traction from six months of public building. Others acknowledged noise oversaturation.

## Key Lessons

- X (Twitter) for building in public has become oversaturated; newer platforms like TikTok and Instagram offer less competitive environments
- Success requires targeting where actual customers exist, not just other indie hackers
- Execution quality matters more than strategy selection
- Risk of getting trapped building exclusively for an indie hacker audience
- Authenticity and relationship-building yield stronger returns than engagement metrics
