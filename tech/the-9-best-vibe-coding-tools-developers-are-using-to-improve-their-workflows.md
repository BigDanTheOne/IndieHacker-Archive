Channing Allen, co-founder of Indie Hackers, compiled a guide to nine AI-powered coding tools. The article notes that "AI coding tools are advancing so quickly that most developers don't know which ones are worth using or how they differ."

The nine tools covered:

1. **Codex CLI** -- OpenAI's terminal-based coding agent with multimodal input support (screenshots, diagrams) using o3 and o4-mini models.

2. **Cursor** -- VS Code fork featuring inline AI editing, smart completion, and built-in agent. $20/month unlimited or usage-based pricing.

3. **Cline** -- VS Code extension with 1.2M+ installs; integrates browser inspection and log reading capabilities.

4. **Roo Code** -- Cline fork with 380k+ installs; includes "Boomerang Tasks" feature for breaking complex work into subtasks.

5. **Windsurf** -- Standalone VS Code-based editor with 2.5M installs; includes 1-click web deployment.

6. **Repo Prompt** -- Minimalist tool for precise codebase context selection; Mac-only currently.

7. **Claude Code** -- Anthropic's terminal agent released early 2025; designed for simplicity without requiring a new IDE.

8. **Aider** -- Terminal-first agent with 2M+ installs; supports most major LLMs, designed for pair programming feel.

9. **Devin** -- Web-based autonomous agent; reduced from $500/month to $20/month; reportedly authors 41% of Gumroad's PRs.

Allen emphasizes that successful tools balance productivity with developer experience--the "vibe" matters. The article positions these as "vibe coding" tools, distinguishing them by their workflow integration and user experience rather than raw capability alone.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Cursor: $20/month subscription
- Devin: $20/month (reduced from $500/month)
- Devin authors 41% of Gumroad's pull requests

**Key Lessons:**
- AI coding tools are advancing so quickly most developers cannot keep up
- Successful tools balance productivity with developer experience
- Workflow integration and user experience matter more than raw capability
- The market spans terminal agents, IDE forks, extensions, and autonomous web-based agents
