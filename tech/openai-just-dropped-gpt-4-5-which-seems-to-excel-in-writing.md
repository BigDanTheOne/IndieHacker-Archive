OpenAI released ChatGPT 4.5, announced by CEO Sam Altman with the statement: "this isn't a reasoning model and won't crush benchmarks. it's a different kind of intelligence."

## Key Features

- Doubled context length for longer conversation memory
- Faster response times with improved emotional intelligence
- Reduced hallucinations through enhanced training techniques
- Better nuance understanding and aesthetic creativity

## Strengths

The model excels particularly in writing tasks. One tester noted the output represents "the first time i've ever thought ai writing was good," comparing it favorably to GPT-4o and Claude alternatives.

## Limitations

- Tends toward "over-refusal" of requests
- Unexpectedly slow performance
- Currently exclusive to $200/month Pro subscribers only
- OpenAI cites GPU constraints: "we're out of GPUs"

## Rollout Plan

Altman confirmed expansion to Plus tier subscribers within a week, with hundreds of thousands of additional GPUs coming online soon.

## Key Lesson

Advanced AI capabilities require substantial computational infrastructure, limiting initial availability despite consumer demand.
