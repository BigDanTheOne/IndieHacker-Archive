Stripe has acquired Bridge, a stablecoin platform, for $1.1 billion -- the company's largest acquisition and the largest in Web3 history.

## Understanding Stablecoins

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with values "pegged" to another currency. Examples include USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT), both pegged to the US dollar at 1:1 ratios.

## Why the $1.1 Billion Price Tag?

The acquisition reflects stablecoin transaction volumes exceeding traditional payment systems. Stablecoins processed transaction volumes "more than doubled Visa's $3.9 trillion in transactions over the second quarter of 2024." Current data shows stablecoins conducting "20x the transaction volume of PayPal and 2x of Visa."

## Strategic Alignment

Bridge functions as "the Web3 version of Stripe," providing a "stablecoin API for developers" enabling code-based stablecoin movement, storage, and acceptance. Bridge previously raised over $58 million from Sequoia Capital and other investors.

## Revenue Numbers

- Acquisition price: $1.1 billion
- Bridge funding: Over $58 million
- Visa quarterly transactions: $3.9 trillion (Q2 2024)

## Key Lessons

1. Major financial platforms follow market trends; stablecoin adoption justifies significant capital investment
2. API-based payment solutions are increasingly valuable as blockchain transactions scale
3. Cryptocurrency remains viable despite AI industry attention

**Tech Stack:** Bridge API, USDC, USDT protocols, Ledn, MetaMask
