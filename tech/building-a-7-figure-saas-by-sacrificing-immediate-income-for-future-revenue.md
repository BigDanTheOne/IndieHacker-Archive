Keith Perhac transitioned from developer to marketer to SaaS founder. After graduating during the dot-com bust, he taught English in Japan for 15 years before his friend Patrick McKenzie encouraged him to start his own venture.

Perhac began freelancing as a technical marketer, which evolved into a consultancy and eventually a CRO agency specializing in data-oriented clients. The agency spent excessive time on reporting, so the team built an internal analytics tool. Clients requested access, and what started as an internal solution became SegMetrics.

In 2020, Perhac shut down the agency to focus entirely on SegMetrics, joining TinySeed during this transition.

## Revenue Model

SegMetrics generates low-to-mid seven figures annually through three streams:
- **MRR (73%):** Flat recurring fees plus metered pricing based on specific metrics
- **Partnerships (16%):** Technical integrations like providing analytics for ConvertKit's Pro users
- **Services (11%):** Training and onboarding that helps recoup acquisition costs

## Revenue Numbers
- Low-to-mid seven figures annually
- >$100K per month
- $1k MRR first week post-launch

## Key Lessons

1. Sacrifice immediate income for sustainable product growth requires decisive organizational commitment
2. Authentic marketing alignment prevents burnout and builds genuine customer connections
3. Staying true to original customer personas prevents brand alienation
4. Partnerships and thought-leader endorsements outperform paid advertising in B2B SaaS
5. Services and training remain valuable despite initial desires for complete self-service models
6. Technical infrastructure investments (columnar databases) should occur earlier in product lifecycle
7. "SaaS is like a marriage -- if you don't like your customers, you're going to have a very hard time wanting to build a great product for them"

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Laravel
- Frontend: Vue.js with InertiaJS
- Infrastructure: DigitalOcean
- Analytics Database: SingleStore (columnar store)
