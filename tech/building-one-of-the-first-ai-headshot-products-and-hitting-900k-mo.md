## About the Founder

Wesley Tian started Aragon after recognizing the potential of Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth AI technologies. He launched full-time at age 25 with $15K-$20K in savings.

## Core Business Model

Aragon generates professional AI headshots, eliminating expensive in-person photoshoots ($250+ traditionally). The platform allows users to customize outfits and backgrounds. B2B clients include Fortune 500 companies; SMBs purchase credits while enterprises negotiate custom contracts.

## Tech Stack

React, Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Heroku, AWS, GraphQL

## Key Lessons

1. **"Launch early"** — Tian emphasizes most founders delay unnecessarily; their initial landing page was poor but timing mattered more than perfection.
2. **Increase "luck surface area"** through authentic social sharing, building in public, and strategic visibility across platforms.
3. **Avoid agencies and part-timers** for hiring; learn roles before recruiting and iterate constantly on processes.
4. **Product quality trumps marketing** — "the most important thing is building a good product."
5. **Move fast with emerging tech** — Identify new technologies and test/adopt quickly rather than hesitating during scaling.
6. **Keep expenses low, margins high** while focusing on conversion rate optimization over vanity metrics.
7. **Build network intentionally** — X, LinkedIn presence, and startup ecosystem connections proved invaluable.
8. **What didn't work:** Cold email outreach and Meta advertising yielded poor results; PR efforts wasted resources.

## Growth Channels

- X and LinkedIn audience building
- Guerrilla marketing (Reddit, Teamblind posts demonstrating product results)
- Affiliate program via Rewardful
- Google search rankings from affiliate links
- Organic viral moments (competitors' feature launches driving awareness)
