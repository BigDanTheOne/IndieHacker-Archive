Bitcoin's recovery from $15,000 lows through institutional ETF adoption, regulatory shifts under Trump administration, and technical indicators suggesting further upside potential.

**Revenue Numbers Mentioned:**
- Bitcoin price: $15,000 (Nov 2022), $69,000 (previous ATH), $73,000 (March 2024), $90,000+ (current)
- ETH price: $900 (Nov 2022), ~$5,000 (previous ATH)
- FTX loss: $9.7 billion
- German government Bitcoin sale: $2.9 billion

**Key Lessons:**
1. Institutional adoption (BlackRock ETF filing June 2023) triggered recovery more than retail enthusiasm
2. Policy environment significantly impacts crypto valuation; Trump's pro-crypto stance accelerated recent gains
3. Market sentiment indicators like Coinbase app rankings and Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D at 60% vs. 40% previously) suggest "peak mania hasn't yet hit"
4. The sector recovered from the 2022 FTX collapse despite predictions of permanent decline
5. Political catalysts can dramatically reprice markets in anticipation of regulatory changes

**Tech Stack Mentioned:**
- Coinbase (exchange platform)
- BlackRock Bitcoin ETF
