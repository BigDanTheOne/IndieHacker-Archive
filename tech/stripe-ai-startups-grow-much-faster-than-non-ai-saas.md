Stripe analyzed payment data from nearly 100 of the highest-grossing privately held AI companies (as of July 31, 2024) versus comparable non-AI SaaS startups from July 2018 to examine growth trajectories.

## Key Findings

AI startups reached $1 million in annual revenue within a median of 11 months, compared to 15 months for traditional SaaS companies -- a four-month advantage. The gap widened substantially at higher revenue levels: AI companies achieved $30 million in approximately 20 months, while non-AI SaaS required over 60 months. This represents roughly five times faster scaling.

Geographically, 56% of AI company revenues originated internationally, with 44% from the US market.

## Revenue Numbers

- $1 million in annual revenue: 11 months (AI) vs. 15 months (non-AI)
- $30 million in revenue: ~20 months (AI) vs. 60+ months (non-AI)
- $8k-$12k monthly (Gemma's AI chatbot generator)
- $8k monthly (Pauline's home staging SaaS)
- $9k MRR (AI2sql)

## Key Lessons

1. **Market Demand is Real:** Companies generate substantial revenue from AI solutions -- it transcends hype.
2. **Profitability is Achievable:** Profitable indie AI projects exist alongside venture-backed models burning capital.
3. **Global Opportunities:** Over half of AI startup revenue derives from international markets.
4. **Important Caveat:** The analyzed companies often operated unprofitably despite high revenues. Indie hackers should consider sustainable models.
