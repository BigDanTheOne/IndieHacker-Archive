The article compares two AI image generators -- Midjourney and Flux (from Black Forest Labs) -- by testing both tools on actual Indie Hackers cover image projects.

For portrait work, the author attempted to create a cover image for a founder interview. Using Midjourney's Discord interface, the tool produced usable results after several iterations.

When testing with Flux Pro (accessed via Replicate at $0.055 per image), the author encountered persistent issues. Despite adjusting parameters like diffusion steps, guidance numbers, and interval numbers, Flux repeatedly added glasses to the subject even when explicitly instructed otherwise.

For abstract imagery (an AI agents cover), Midjourney generated compelling results immediately. Flux produced visually striking but more complex outputs that resembled "Ex Machina" aesthetics.

## Key Lessons

- Different tools excel at different tasks
- Fine-tuning parameters yields varied results
- Tool selection depends on specific project requirements and visual style preferences
- AI image generation continues advancing rapidly

**Tech Stack:** Midjourney (Discord bot interface), Flux Pro via Replicate, Black Forest Labs API
