Adrian Horning transitioned from a psychology major to software engineer after discovering tech during an internship. He attended a coding bootcamp, worked for Lyft, and delivered food by bicycle while building savings. After quitting his job in 2022, he pursued entrepreneurship while freelancing.

In June 2024, Horning launched Scrape Creators, a real-time social media scraping API. The decision stemmed from his passion for scraping and alignment with his existing audience—some students from his scraping courses became early customers. Currently it generates over $10,000 MRR.

**Product Model:** Credits-based, usage-based pricing structure similar to AI companies.

**Growth Challenges & Solutions:** The turning point came when he committed entirely to Scrape Creators, eliminating distractions. This singular focus proved transformative.

**Primary Growth Channels:**
- Direct messages on X (formerly Twitter)
- Organic Google search traffic

Horning leveraged his established Twitter presence built through free content sharing. He also scraped his own Twitter followers, identified likely prospects, and manually messaged them—acquiring paying customers this way.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $10,000+ MRR
- By March 2025, the product was paying most of his bills
- Grew from zero through organic channels

**Key Lessons:**
- Singular focus transforms results: Eliminating side projects allowed exponential growth
- Audience + expertise = advantage: Combining social following with deep technical knowledge accelerates traction
- Free value precedes paid revenue: Distributing free credits and content builds trust
- "The best business idea is the one you started 3 years ago"
- Authenticity over automation: Manual outreach outperformed algorithmic approaches
- Compounding effort matters: Starting imperfectly beats perpetually restarting

**Tech Stack:**
Render, AWS Lambda, Supabase, Firebase (auth), Netlify, React, Astro
