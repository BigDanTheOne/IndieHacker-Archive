Charlie Clark, solo founder of Liinks, carved a $25k/mo niche in the saturated link-in-bio market by undercutting the competition on price and focusing on superior user experience.

## Revenue Numbers

- Current MRR: $25,000/month
- Pricing: $4/mo (Premium), $10/mo (Pro plan)
- Previous ventures: The Colors of Motion (upper five figures), VSUAL (six figures GMV with razor-thin margins)
- Time to profitability: ~4.5 years after launch

## Key Lessons

1. **Ship Early:** Clark launched Liinks two weeks after starting development, contrasting with six months spent on a previous project before getting user feedback.
2. **Strategic Pricing:** Started at $3/mo, experimented with $2.99, $3.99, and $5, settling on $4/mo for simplicity and conversion rates.
3. **Remove Friction:** Eliminating the freemium model reduced moderation burden caused by spam and phishing attempts, paradoxically increasing paid conversions.
4. **User-Centric Design:** Achieved fewer than five weekly support requests through intuitive interface design.
5. **Balance Growth Ambition:** Rather than pursue venture capital, Clark prioritized work-life balance, family time, and sustainable profitability.
6. **Ask 'Then What?':** Regularly question decisions using long-term thinking rather than chasing endless growth metrics.

## Growth Strategies

- Cold outreach targeting Instagram creators
- Product-led growth through "Made with Liinks" badges
- Instagram and Google ads (achieving $1/click, $30/conversion ratios)
- User data analysis via Amplitude and FullStory
- Feature development based on customer requests

**Tech Stack:** Digital Ocean VPS, Managed MongoDB, AWS S3 + Cloudfront, NodeJS (Express), React
