Matthias Neumayer and Dima Rubanov reconnected during the pandemic to build software together. What began as a side project evolved into a bootstrapped startup studio generating $6,000 monthly revenue across multiple products.

## Products

- **Oscar Stories:** Children's bedtime story generator (60,000 users, launched March 2023)
- **Branding5:** DIY brand positioning tool
- **FragDasPDF:** German-language PDF chatbot for students and researchers

## Revenue Numbers

- Current MRR: $6,000/month
- Oscar Stories Users: 60,000

## Key Lessons

1. "Any kind of SaaS product, you're building for the user. Not that imaginary user you think of when you start."
2. Establish personal runway before committing -- have solid savings before quitting employment
3. In-person validation is invaluable -- physical events revealed UX issues invisible in remote testing
4. Monitor actual user behavior -- assumptions about target markets proved wrong repeatedly
5. Experiment with pricing models -- hybrid subscription-plus-coin systems worked better than subscription-only
6. Collaborate with domain experts for scientific validity
7. Set ambitious goals -- initial targets shouldn't be ceilings

**Tech Stack:** Next.js, React Native, Express.js, Firebase, Supabase, Gemini Flash, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python
