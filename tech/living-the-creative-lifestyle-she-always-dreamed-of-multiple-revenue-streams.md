## Company: Logology
## Founder: Lucie Baratte

## Revenue Numbers

- **Logology current revenue:** ~$450/month average
- **Peak revenue:** $2,500/month
- **Package pricing:** $69-$119 for standard logos; $799 for customization
- **Bespoke services:** ~$3,000 with extended brand guidelines
- **Teaching/lectures:** ~$1,200/month
- **Freelancing:** ~$700/month

## Key Lessons

1. **Product-first pitfall:** The founding team prioritized product perfection over marketing strategy, delaying sustainable growth.
2. **Cofounder alignment matters:** "unspoken or unconsidered differences in expectations among the cofounders" led to team dissolution and personal strain.
3. **Diversification works:** Multiple income streams (SaaS, teaching, freelancing, writing) enabled financial stability without heavy VC dependence.
4. **Naivete has trade-offs:** Optimism fueled the venture but pragmatism about business fundamentals would have strengthened outcomes.
5. **Solo resilience:** Operating independently allowed reconnection with personal vision despite reduced bandwidth.
