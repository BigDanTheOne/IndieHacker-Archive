Dan Kulkov started indie hacking after his startup ran out of venture funding. He began with a simple directory of tools featuring excellent free plans for founders, aiming to prove he could earn money online.

Over three years, Kulkov launched five products across various business models, including content products, directories, services, and SaaS platforms. His portfolio included MakerBox (content and marketing services generating ~$130k), FounderPal (AI marketing platform generating ~$215k), Lead Magnet Examples (generating ~$1k monthly), Sponsor This Newsletter (acquired for ~$20k), and Smooz (which generated $0).

Kulkov emphasized building an audience before creating products. He developed his personal brand through X and newsletters, establishing authority in marketing for founders and indie hackers. When ChatGPT launched, he pivoted to create FounderPal as an AI-powered marketing platform, initially built with no-code tools (Bubble and Xano), later transitioning to NextJS, Supabase, and Vercel.

**Growth channels that worked:**
- Building free AI tools for SEO optimization
- Audience development on multiple platforms (YouTube, TikTok, LinkedIn)
- Facebook advertising, particularly retargeting
- Product directory sponsorships
- Free newsletters nurturing audiences
- Programmatic SEO with data-driven pages
- Affiliate marketing

**Ineffective channels:**
- Newsletter sponsorships, referral programs, Google Ads, Twitter ads, Reddit audience building, outdated product directories

Regarding Smooz's failure, Kulkov noted insufficient market validation. He built without adequate user interviews, discovering too late that target customers needed extensive onboarding incompatible with a $9 monthly price point.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- MakerBox: ~$130,000 over 3 years
- FounderPal: ~$215,000 over 2 years
- Lead Magnet Examples: ~$1,000 in first month
- Sponsor This Newsletter: ~$20,000 before acquisition
- Smooz: $0
- Current combined: $10,000 monthly
- FounderPal day-one: $1,249
- FounderPal first 6 months: $60,000+

**Key Lessons:**
- "Audience first, product second" drives sustainable growth
- Multiple small bets distribute risk better than single large projects
- Market validation through interviews prevents wasted development
- Free tools function as long-term SEO engines with compounding benefits
- Testing diverse marketing channels reveals platform-specific effectiveness
- Transparency about failures provides valuable learning

**Tech Stack:**
Bubble (initial), Xano (initial backend), NextJS, Supabase, Vercel
