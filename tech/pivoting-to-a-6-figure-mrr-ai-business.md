## Full Article

Flo Crivello built Teamflow, a virtual office platform that thrived during the pandemic but declined afterward. When OpenAI released the GPT-3 API in mid-2022, he recognized an opportunity to pivot toward AI agents. After ChatGPT's launch, he committed fully to building Lindy -- described as the "Zapier of AI" -- a no-code platform enabling users to create AI agents for automation tasks like lead qualification, customer support, and CRM updates.

## Key Lessons

1. **Speed in Major Decisions:** "I wish we'd made the big changes faster" -- staying roughly 2 months too long in each paradigm equated to approximately one wasted year.
2. **Trust Intuition:** Tech founders often overthink; listening to gut instincts about fundamental gaps proves valuable.
3. **Usage-Based Pricing:** Credits-based pricing aligns with the vision of "AI employees" and provides genuine product-market-fit signals -- "Dollars are the only truth."
4. **Choose Your Game:** Differentiate between "lean startup" and "fat startup" models, then commit fully.
5. **Meaningful Work Matters:** Founders need existential alignment with their mission across 20-year commitments.
6. **Marketing Strategy:** Two-three annual launches generate 10-50k signups; social media yields greater ROI than events.
7. **Psychological Health:** Exercise 3x weekly, nature time, and social connections sustain long-term founder performance.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
- **Backend:** Node, MongoDB
- **Infrastructure:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
