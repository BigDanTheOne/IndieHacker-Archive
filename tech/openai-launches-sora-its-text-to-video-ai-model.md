OpenAI has officially launched Sora, its text-to-video AI model, for ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers. The tool generates videos up to 20 seconds long through a ChatGPT-style interface where users can upload assets or request fully AI-generated content.

The "Turbo" version available at sora.com is significantly faster than the February preview and produces 1080p quality videos. Some users report creating 10-second clips in under a minute. Videos support widescreen, vertical, and square aspect ratios.

**Capability Assessment:**
Example videos demonstrate planetary flybys and creative scenarios, though motion sometimes appears unnatural. The model struggles with realistic human hands -- a notable limitation shared with predecessor image generation tools. User feedback indicates the "Blend" feature effectively transitions between different shots, but longer narratives remain challenging.

**Access & Pricing:**
- **Pro subscribers** ($200/month): Longer, higher-quality videos with 10x usage allowance
- **Plus subscribers** ($20/month): Up to 50 480p videos or fewer at 720p quality monthly

Notably, Sora remains unavailable across most EU countries, Switzerland, and the UK.

**Technical Limitations:**
OpenAI acknowledges issues with "unrealistic physics" and "complex actions over long durations." The company intentionally restricts deepfake capabilities and sexual content generation.

**Key Lessons:**
1. Rollout capacity constraints affect user experience despite technological advancement
2. Tiered access models leverage premium subscribers for higher-quality features
3. Proactive safeguards (watermarks, metadata, content restrictions) address responsibility concerns
4. Geographic regulatory differences create fragmented product availability

**Tech Stack Mentioned:**
- ChatGPT interface framework
- 1080p video generation capability
- Watermarking and metadata systems
