xAI has released an improved Grok-2 large language model available to all X users. The enhanced model is three times faster than its predecessor and features web search capabilities, photorealistic image generation via the Aurora model, and the ability to cite external sources and X posts in responses.

All X users can access Grok-2 through the left-hand panel or at x.com/i/grok. Premium and Premium+ subscribers receive higher usage allowances and faster access to updates. The model is also available to developers via the xAI API (grok-2-1212 and grok-2-vision-1212).

xAI positions Grok as providing "unfiltered answers" with fewer content restrictions than competitors like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude. The model has generated controversial content, including tasteless images when the beta launched in August.

**Revenue/Pricing Numbers:**
- Grok-2 API: $2 per 10 million output tokens; $10 per 1 million output tokens
- New users receive $25 free API credits
- GPT-4o: $2.50 per million input tokens; $5 per million output tokens
- Claude Sonnet 3.5: $3 per million input tokens; $15 per million output tokens

**Key Lessons:**
- Speed and accessibility drive adoption; free tiers attract broader user bases
- Content moderation approaches differentiate AI products in competitive markets
- Integration with existing platforms maximizes feature discoverability

**Tech Stack Mentioned:**
- Aurora (autoregressive image generation model)
- xAI API
- X platform integration
