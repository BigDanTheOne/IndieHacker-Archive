Infinity AI launched an updated video generation model. The core functionality allows users to convert a static face image into a speaking animated character by providing either text or audio input.

The technology enables rapid creation of realistic AI-speaking characters with minimal input. Potential applications include localization, explainer videos, and accessible content creation.

Community discussion covers facial animation synchronization, marketing strategies, and startup potential. Some suggest organic Reddit marketing would be more effective than hype-driven promotion, emphasizing practical use cases and ethical transparency.
