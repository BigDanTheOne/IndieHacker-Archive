AJ built Carrd by leveraging experience from earlier projects (HTML5 UP templates, Pixelarity). Rather than pursuing a crowded market head-on, he focused on solving one specific need elegantly: simple one-page website creation. The product achieved $2M ARR through exceptional user experience, no paid marketing, and an existing audience from previous work.

## Revenue Numbers

- Current ARR: $2M (approximately $167K monthly)
- Previous product (Pixelarity): Made some money but minimal revenue

## Key Lessons

1. **Intentional Constraint as Strategy:** AJ deliberately limited functionality to one-page sites rather than attempting to compete with Squarespace, making the product achievable as a solo developer.
2. **UX-First Design:** "I'm big on deciding on a given user experience and working backward from it, as opposed to treating UX as an afterthought."
3. **Frictionless Onboarding:** Users can build without account creation initially; accounts only required at publishing stage.
4. **Product-Driven Growth:** The business grew entirely through word-of-mouth with an unobtrusive "Made with Carrd" footer link on free sites.
5. **Knowing When to Scale:** AJ transitioned from solo development to hiring when recognizing that solo work was bottlenecking growth.
6. **Strategic VC Partnership:** Accepting investment for expertise and connections rather than capital needs, given the business was already profitable.

**Tech Stack:** HTML5/CSS, website template design
