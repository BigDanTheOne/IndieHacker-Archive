OpenAI has released o1, previously codenamed "Strawberry," a new series of AI models designed to spend extra time reasoning through complex, multi-step tasks. Two variants exist: o1-preview (most powerful) and o1-mini (80% cheaper, optimized for coding).

The o1 models use chain-of-thought reasoning combined with reinforcement learning, breaking problems into sequential steps. When encountering obstacles, they attempt alternative approaches. OpenAI hasn't published detailed research, though experts hypothesize a separate critic model scores outputs.

Performance benchmarks show dramatic improvements over GPT-4o in mathematics (AIME 2024), coding (CodeForces), and PhD-level science questions (GPQA Diamond). However, Sam Altman cautioned that o1 "seems more impressive on first use than after spending more time with it."

This advancement represents a paradigm shift from previous "stochastic parrots" that predicted answers based on training data. Reasoning researcher Noam Brown stated o1 "thinks for seconds" with future versions potentially "thinking for hours, days, even weeks."

Access requires ChatGPT Plus ($20/month) or team subscription ($25/user/month).

## Key Lessons

- Reasoning capability marks AI's evolution beyond pattern recognition
- Early experimentation essential for identifying practical applications
- Multiple model tiers serve different use cases efficiently

**Tech Stack:** ChatGPT, reinforcement learning, chain-of-thought methodology
