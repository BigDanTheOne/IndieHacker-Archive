Lemon Squeezy, a payment platform for digital businesses, has significantly reduced payout fees following its acquisition by Stripe in July 2024. U.S. bank payouts are now free (previously 0.5% + $2.50), while international transfers cost 1% (down from 3% + $2.50). PayPal payouts remain at $0.50 for U.S. accounts and 3% (capped at $30) internationally.

The platform's 5% + $0.50 transaction fee remains unchanged. CEO JR Farr stated: "This fee reduction is just one example of how we're continually working to improve our platform."
