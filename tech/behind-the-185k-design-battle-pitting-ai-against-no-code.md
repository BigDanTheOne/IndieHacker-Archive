Two indie hackers competed in a 45-minute live design contest watched by 35,000 viewers:

- **Brett Williams**: Webflow veteran, $1M+ ARR web design studio (Designjoy), 10+ years experience
- **Henrik Westerlund**: 19-year-old marketing dropout, Lovable AI tool user, zero design experience

The rivalry started on X/Twitter when Henrik claimed "Webflow's officially dead." Brett challenged him to a live design battle. Polymarket betting reached $185,000.

**Result:** Brett won unanimously among judges and audience (83% X poll approval), though Henrik impressed observers with his energy and capability despite inexperience.

## Revenue Numbers

- Brett's monthly revenue: $145,000
- Brett's annual revenue: $1,000,000+
- Polymarket betting pool: $185,000

## Key Lessons

1. "Speed over polish" matters for indie hackers
2. "Turn your building process into a show" generates engagement
3. Design principles and fundamental knowledge still matter; AI alone lacks strategic thinking
4. Personality and energy can win audiences even without winning technically

## Tech Stack

- **Webflow** (Brett's platform)
- **Lovable** (AI product for text-based web app generation)
