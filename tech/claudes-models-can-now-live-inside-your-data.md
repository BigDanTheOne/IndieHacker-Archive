Anthropic released the "Model Context Protocol" (MCP), described as "a new standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems where data lives." This development helps developers avoid writing custom code to integrate AI models with various data sources including Slack conversations, Google Drive documents, GitHub repositories, and Postgres databases.

A demonstration showed Claude desktop app functionality where MCP integration enabled connection to GitHub, repository creation, and pull request generation in under an hour.

**Key Lessons:**
- MCP reduces development friction for AI-data integration
- Integration complexity can be significantly reduced with proper protocols
- AI model accessibility to distributed data systems is becoming standardized

**Tech Stack Mentioned:**
- Claude (AI model)
