HARO (Help A Reporter Out) is ceasing operations after 16 years. Founded in 2008 by Peter Shankman, the service connected journalists posting queries with sources offering pitches, often resulting in published features and backlinks from major publications like the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.

The platform's decline accelerated following ChatGPT's 2022 release, which flooded journalists with AI-generated spam. Parent company Cision's 2024 rebrand to "Connectively" proved problematic -- poor communication about the name change, a drawn-out transition, loss of the email newsletter format, and introduction of paid pitching options all contributed to user churn and reputation damage.

PR expert Sacha Fournier noted that "the worsening conversion rate, combined with the fact you had to pay to pitch, was giving the platform a bad reputation." Former agency owner Elvis Sun described Cision as "a dinosaur that moves way too slowly." The service closes December 9th, 2024.

**Alternatives mentioned:**
- PressPulse (Elvis Sun's project)
- JournoFinder (Sacha Fournier's project)
- Source of Sources (Peter Shankman's 2x daily email service)

**Key Lessons:**
- Legacy companies struggle with rapid adaptation to new technologies
- Poor change management (rebranding, removing popular features) drives user exodus
- AI-generated content can degrade platform quality and user trust
- Charging for previously free services requires careful implementation
