Two founders launched competing AI necklace products called "Friend" within days of each other in late July 2024. Nik Shevchenko released his open-source Friend necklace on July 26th via Product Hunt, where it topped the leaderboard. Avi Schiffmann announced his Friend AI necklace on July 30th to 23.6M Twitter views.

The dispute escalated when Nik released a critical song about Avi on Twitter, alleging copying and criticizing his reliance on social media fame. Avi countered by claiming Nik copied his earlier Tab product and merely rebranded it.

Both founders demonstrated theatrical marketing approaches. Avi invested $1.8M in the Friend.com domain name (generating 5,100 backlinks), while Nik created the diss track and reportedly marketed to San Francisco's homeless population.

## Revenue Numbers

- $1.8M domain purchase by Avi Schiffmann

## Key Lessons

- AI wearables face significant market challenges (Rabbit R1 and Humane AI Pin both failed)
- Controversy generates visibility in competitive markets
- Product differentiation matters when competitors occupy similar spaces
