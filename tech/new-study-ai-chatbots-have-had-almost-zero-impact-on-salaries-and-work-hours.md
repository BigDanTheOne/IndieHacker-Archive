A Danish study surveying over 25,000 workers and 7,000 workplaces across 11 AI-exposed occupations found that despite widespread chatbot adoption, there has been virtually no detectable impact on earnings or work hours.

Researchers Anders Humlum (University of Chicago) and Emilie Vestergaard (University of Copenhagen) analyzed data linked to actual monthly earnings and hours through Denmark's employer-employee registry system, comparing workers using chatbots with similar non-users before and after adoption became common.

Key findings: time savings averaged approximately 3%, salary impact showed "precisely estimated zeros," and work hours showed no reduction despite time savings. However, 50-95% of new job tasks across occupations were directly linked to AI use, and 15-40% of new tasks involved integrating AI chatbots into workflows.

The paradox: workers are reallocating saved time into managing the AI tools themselves rather than reducing overall work hours or increasing compensation. The research indicates that "companies that adopt new tech often get less productive before they get more productive."

Most employers encouraged chatbot use, nearly 40% deployed in-house AI models, and 30% of workers received formal training. The disconnect stems from organizational behavior: efficiency gains do not automatically translate to reduced workloads without deliberate workflow redesign and systemic change.

**Key Lessons:**
- AI chatbot adoption shows virtually no detectable impact on earnings or work hours
- Time savings of ~3% are reallocated to managing AI tools themselves
- 50-95% of new job tasks across occupations are directly linked to AI use
- Efficiency gains require deliberate workflow redesign to translate into reduced workloads
- "Companies that adopt new tech often get less productive before they get more productive"
