## Revenue Numbers

- **BoltAI:** $15k-$30k/month (average ~$25k)
- **PDF Pals:** $1k-$2k/month
- **KTool:** $1.5k MRR
- **Combined portfolio:** $18k-$34k/month

## Key Lessons

1. **Kill ideas ruthlessly** -- "Persistence is overrated. It doesn't make sense to keep working on the wrong thing."
2. **Pricing flexibility** -- Testing revealed non-linear elasticity; raising BoltAI from $9 to $79 increased sales, but $79 to $110 reduced unit volume while maintaining revenue.
3. **Perpetual licensing works** -- The "1 year of updates" model proved more palatable to consumers than subscriptions, following precedents like JetBrains and TablePlus.
4. **Engineering as marketing** -- Free tools (ShotSolve, The Orb, Oh One Pro) generate qualified leads with minimal ongoing effort.
5. **Multi-channel growth** -- Success required combining Twitter visibility, AI directories, PPC ads, communities (Reddit's r/macapps), Setapp partnerships, and emerging SEO efforts.
6. **Focus beats burnout** -- Emphasizes marketing discipline and customer conversations over endless product work.
