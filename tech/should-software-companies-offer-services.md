Jason Levin, founder of Memelord Technologies, initially rejected the idea of offering services alongside his SaaS product. He believed consulting would distract from scalable software development. However, after reading about Palantir's success as a "glorified consultancy," his perspective shifted.

Levin discovered that hands-on customer engagement revealed valuable product insights. After spending time with a customer in Miami, he observed genuine use cases and identified bugs and feature opportunities. This led him to establish a rule: his team would only consult on projects where they actively used their own software.

The company converted a $6.90/month customer into a multi-thousand-dollar consulting engagement, managing the customer's social media account while simultaneously improving the product.

During Cyber Monday, Levin launched a meme delivery service ($420.69/month for daily memes; $699/month for three daily), signing 30 clients within a week.

## Revenue Numbers

- Original customer: $6.90/month converted to multi-thousand-dollar consulting deal
- New service pricing: $420.69/month and $699/month tiers
- 30 new clients signed within one week

## Key Lessons

- Services and software can complement each other when services use and improve the core product
- Customer immersion generates superior product development insights
- Not all software companies should offer services; context matters
- The "ontology" approach: understand where software fits in daily customer procedures and identify time-saving opportunities
