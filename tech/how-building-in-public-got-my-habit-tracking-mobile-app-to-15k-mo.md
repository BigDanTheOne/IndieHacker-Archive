Sebastian Rohl, founder of HabitKit habit-tracking app, went from software engineer to indie hacker. His first app Liftbear failed, but HabitKit succeeded through building in public on Twitter/X and App Store optimization.

## Revenue Numbers

- Current MRR: $7,800 (app subscriptions)
- Monthly recurring from lifetime purchases: $7,300
- Peak revenue: $33,000 in single month (Christmas/New Year season)
- Total monthly revenue: ~$15,000

## Key Lessons

1. **Building in public drives growth:** "Building in public on Twitter/X has been by far the most successful way I've grown and marketed my apps."
2. **Simplicity wins:** Focus on solving one problem exceptionally well rather than creating feature-heavy solutions.
3. **App Store optimization matters:** Nearly 98% of new users discovered through direct App Store/Google Play searches.
4. **Patience is essential:** Success develops incrementally over time, not overnight.
5. **Find sustainable marketing:** Choose long-term strategies aligned with your strengths.

**Tech Stack:** Flutter (cross-platform iOS/Android), offline-only app with local device storage (no backend required), freemium with subscriptions and lifetime licenses
