The piece examines how the "build in public" movement -- once celebrated for creating transparency and community -- is being abandoned by successful founders who've reached profitability. The article argues this shift represents evolution rather than extinction.

## Key Argument

Founders who openly shared revenue metrics and progress once inspired others and attracted customers. However, as visibility increased, so did copycat competition. Successful builders are now strategically disappearing into "stealth mode" to protect their competitive advantages.

## Revenue Numbers Mentioned

- **$10K MRR threshold:** Suggested point where sharing should stop
- **$30K+ MRR:** Phase for selective transparency only
- **Marc Lou's January 2025:** $124,772 across multiple projects
- **Sabba Keynejad (VEED.IO):** Scaled to $500K MRR
- **Francesco Di Lorenzo (Typefully):** Referenced $42k/month entry price

## Key Lessons

1. **Phase-based approach:**
   - Phases 0-$10K: Share everything
   - $10K+: Remove metrics; share stories instead
   - $30K+: Occasional milestone updates only
2. **Copycat reality:** Most clones fail within months; execution matters more than ideas
3. **Mental health impact:** Public metrics amplify stress during downturns
4. **Safety concerns:** Revenue transparency invites unwanted attention
