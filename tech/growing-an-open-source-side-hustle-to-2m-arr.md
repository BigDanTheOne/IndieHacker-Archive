## Revenue Numbers

- Current ARR: $2M
- Monthly Revenue: $167K
- Initial infrastructure cost: ~$50/month
- Current infrastructure cost: Five figures monthly

## Key Lessons

1. **Capital Conservation:** Founder exchanged time capital instead of financial or lifestyle capital, working two jobs for three years until the side project matched his full-time income.

2. **Speed Over Perfection:** "Just get the damn thing out the door and see if you get any sign-ups. Quite literally: Nothing else matters until the idea is tested."

3. **Familiar Technology Stack:** Use tech you know well (90%) to minimize time to market rather than exploring new technologies.

4. **Content as Growth Driver:** Content marketing proved most effective, particularly "show don't tell" approaches that build credibility even among non-customers.

5. **Strategic Hiring:** Know your weaknesses and hire capable people to fill those gaps.

6. **Patience Required:** Early growth moves incrementally, especially while maintaining full-time employment.

## Tech Stack

- Containerization: Docker
- Infrastructure: Terraform (currently); Kubernetes considered but initially avoided
- Frontend: React on Netlify
- Database: Simple database infrastructure
- Core: Custom load-balancers, open-source container image
- Key Libraries Supported: Puppeteer, Playwright
- New Protocol: BrowserQL (proprietary in-house library)

## Business Model

Volume-based SaaS charging model based on usage time plus add-ons. Growth focuses on new user acquisition driving expansion as customers need increased capacity.
