**Key Issues Documented:**

1. **September Outage** - Nearly 10-hour SMTP service disruption caused by an expired SSL certificate. The alert was initially dismissed as a false alarm before being addressed hours later.

2. **Account Deactivations** - Razvan Ilin's account was deactivated without warning just before Thanksgiving. Support took five days to respond and confirm no wrongdoing occurred.

3. **Link Classification** - Pieter Levels reported Microsoft Defender flagging Postmark links as malicious, though Postmark disputed this was widespread.

4. **Post-Acquisition Concerns** - The 2022 ActiveCampaign acquisition prompted speculation about team changes and service degradation.

**Notable Quotes:**
- Levels initially praised Postmark: "I love everything about Postmark, from the sign up, the login, the design, the colors, to the interface"
- Jack Ellis criticized changes: "The only changes I've seen since then are price hikes, extra cost for adjusted email retention period"
- Courtney Allen highlighted billing concerns about overage charges without corresponding credits

**Key Lessons:** Operational excellence and transparency matter significantly to bootstrapped startups; trust erodes quickly after critical failures.

**Tech Stack:** SMTP protocol, SSL certificates, webhook notifications
