Trump launched the $TRUMP meme coin on January 17th, just three days before his inauguration. The token became "the fastest-growing meme coin to hit a $15B market cap," surging over 10,000% in value and reaching $3 billion within the first hour.

CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC -- entities affiliated with the Trump Organization -- collectively own 80% of tokens. The initial supply of 200 million tokens will expand by another 800 million over three years.

The article highlights meme coins' volatile nature, citing $HAWK's collapse from $490M to $60M in 20 minutes, with some investors losing $130,000. Trump's incoming team includes crypto advocates like VP-elect JD Vance, Elon Musk, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, suggesting potential mainstream adoption momentum.

## Revenue Numbers

- $15 billion market cap (achieved)
- $3 billion valuation (first hour)
- $490 million (HAWK peak)
- $60 million (HAWK crash)
- $130,000 (individual investor loss example)

## Key Lessons

1. Meme coins represent extreme volatility and risk
2. Political figures leveraging crypto creates mainstream legitimacy questions
