Danielle Johnson and James Ivings left traditional employment in 2016 to travel while building software. Their journey spans eight years of nomadic development across buses, boats, and various continents.

## Products Developed

1. **ReleasePage** -- GitHub release notes tool (minimal traction; ~$600 total)
2. **Leave Me Alone** -- Email unsubscription and inbox management service (launched January 2019)
3. **Ellie** -- AI email writing extension (launched 2022; $1,500/month)
4. **StartKit.AI** -- AI SaaS boilerplate with image generation, audio transcription, and chat features

## Revenue Numbers

- Leave Me Alone: Generated hundreds of dollars monthly initially, then doubled until April 2023
- Ellie: Approximately $1,500 per month with low churn
- Combined total: Over $7,500 monthly across three products

## Key Lessons

- "The shorter amount of time you can spend prototyping an MVP, the better"
- Organic marketing proved most effective; paid strategies showed minimal impact
- Indie hacking success requires balancing work with lifestyle priorities
- Survivorship bias dominates social media; sustainable growth takes time

**Tech Stack:** Vanilla JavaScript and HTML, SetApp API, GitHub integration
