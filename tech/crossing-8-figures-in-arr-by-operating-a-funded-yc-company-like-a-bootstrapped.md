## Revenue Numbers
- Over $833,000 monthly ($10M+ ARR)
- Target: $50M ARR with fewer than 50 employees

## Key Lessons

1. **Pricing Strategy**: Avoid low-cost tiers that attract churning customers. Focus on serious teams willing to pay full price.

2. **Growth Channels**: The most effective methods were word-of-mouth, Chrome Webstore discovery, and content marketing. Paid ads and splashy launches consistently underperformed.

3. **Retention Focus**: "As you scale a SaaS business, your net churn is a % of your current revenue" -- prioritizing churn reduction matters more than new customer acquisition.

4. **Momentum Maintenance**: Breaking projects into six-week increments prevents losing momentum, even if less efficient short-term.

5. **Product Quality**: "The era of MVPs that you throw at the wall is kind of over" -- today's competitive landscape demands world-class products.

6. **Customer-Centric Integration**: Deep Gmail integration required reverse-engineering the UI to feel seamless rather than bolted-on.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Serverless (AppEngine), later migrated for cost optimization
- Frontend: jQuery initially, migrated to React
- Infrastructure: Gmail API integration
