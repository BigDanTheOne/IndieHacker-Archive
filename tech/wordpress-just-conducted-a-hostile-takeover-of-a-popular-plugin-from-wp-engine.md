WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg orchestrated a hostile takeover of Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), a widely-used plugin owned by WP Engine. This escalation represents a dramatic development in an ongoing dispute between Mullenweg and WP Engine executives.

The conflict began when Mullenweg published a blog post calling WP Engine a "cancer" to WordPress and demanding trademark licensing fees. WP Engine responded with a cease-and-desist letter on September 23, and Mullenweg later revealed on Reddit that WP Engine was asked to pay 8% of their revenue as compensation.

Rather than forking ACF in the traditional sense, WordPress seized the original plugin directory entry, user reviews, installation count, and forum messages -- leaving WP Engine with only a code copy. WordPress rebranded it as "Secure Custom Fields" (SCF), claiming the action addressed security vulnerabilities and removed commercial upsells.

The community response has been critical. Pieter Levels suggested migrating to Ghost.org, noting the situation entered "dangerous territory" affecting millions of WordPress installations. David Heinemeier Hansson warned against becoming a "mad king," urging resolution through courts rather than platform expropriations.

## Revenue Numbers

- WP Engine generates over $400 million annually
- 159 Automattic employees (8.4% of workforce) accepted $30,000 buyouts to leave

## Key Lessons

- Concentrated platform power enables unilateral action against third parties
- Disputes between ecosystem leaders create collateral damage for users
- Governance disputes require judicial rather than executive resolution

**Tech Stack:** WordPress (43% of all websites), ACF plugin, SCF (replacement fork)
