## Revenue Numbers
- Current MRR: $24,000 (peaked earlier in 2024)
- Target for InboxFusion by end of 2025: $10,000+ MRR
- Bluetick peak capacity: 900,000+ emails/day

## Key Lessons

1. **Audience Building Nuance:** "You need to build the right audience specifically interested in your product," not just any audience.

2. **Enterprise Risk:** Heavy reliance on few customers creates instability -- one customer represented major revenue concentration for Bluetick.

3. **Pivot Necessity:** Resisting cold email for years proved counterproductive; pivoting to meet market demand transformed profitability.

4. **SEO Regret:** Taber identifies SEO as "probably the biggest mistake," underutilized for long-tail content generation.

5. **Community Importance:** "Find your people" through communities and identify repeatable customer acquisition methods.
