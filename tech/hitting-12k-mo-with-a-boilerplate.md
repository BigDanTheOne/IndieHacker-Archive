Jonathan Wilke started freelancing in web development at age 16, eventually becoming a web architect. While maintaining a small agency with a friend, he repeatedly rebuilt identical boilerplate code for client projects. This inefficiency inspired him to create Supastarter.

After developing an initial version over three months, Wilke tested the market by building a simple website and adding a Stripe payment link priced at $49. His first sale arrived within a week. Nearly three years later, Supastarter has evolved into a popular starter kit for modern JavaScript frameworks, now priced at $349 with over 800 customers generating approximately $12,000 monthly revenue.

Supastarter offers three framework variants: Next.js, Nuxt, and SvelteKit, each featuring similar architectural foundations.

**Growth Strategy: Building in Public**
Wilke accumulates approximately 8,000 followers on X. He shares progress, gathers feedback, and ranks X consistently among the platform's top three traffic sources. Supplementary marketing includes sponsored newsletters, developer directory listings, technical blog posts, and SEO.

**Pricing Philosophy:**
"I started selling Supastarter at $49. I should have started at $149 or more. A higher price creates a higher quality perception." The price evolved from $49 to $349.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $12,000/month MRR
- Initial price: $49; current: $349
- 800+ customers
- Nearly three years of operation

**Key Lessons:**
- Solve personal problems first: Tools addressing genuine internal pain points provide intrinsic motivation
- Iterate continuously based on customer feedback
- Build in public: Transparent progress sharing builds community trust
- Price appropriately: Underpricing undermines perceived quality
- Quality drives growth: Product excellence generates sustainable word-of-mouth
- Productize services: Developers can escape time-based billing by systematizing repetitive work

**Tech Stack:**
Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Turborepo, Prisma, Hono, better-auth, TailwindCSS, RadixUI, TanstackQuery
