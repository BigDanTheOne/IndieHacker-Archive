Bench, launched in 2012, provided bookkeeping and tax services to over 35,000 US businesses before abruptly ceasing operations on December 27, 2024. The company had secured $113 million in funding from prominent investors including Shopify and Bain Capital Ventures.

The shutdown notification offered minimal assistance: "We regret to inform you that as of December 27, 2024, the Bench platform will no longer be accessible."

Ian Crosby, the original CEO and co-founder, revealed that strategic disagreements with board members led to his removal in 2021. The board sought to redirect the company's focus, which Crosby believed was misguided. After his departure, service quality deteriorated, validating his concerns.

## Key Lessons

1. **Founder replacement risks:** Replacing founding vision with professional management often fails
2. **VC control consequences:** Accepting venture capital dilutes founder control over strategic direction
3. **Customer abandonment:** Sudden shutdowns leave users with no transition period or support
4. **Bootstrapping appeal:** Independent, funded-by-revenue businesses maintain control and accountability
5. **Service degradation:** Post-2021 customer feedback indicated declining service quality following leadership change
