Chinese AI company DeepSeek launched DeepSeek-R1, a reasoning model competing with OpenAI's o1. Available through free chat and low-cost API access, it outperforms o1 on certain benchmarks including math, word problems, and programming tasks.

The 671-billion-parameter model uses extended reasoning processes to improve response accuracy. Smaller, distilled versions can run locally on laptops. All versions are open source under MIT license, allowing commercial use by indie developers.

## Performance

DeepSeek-R1 excels on AIME 2024, MATH-500, and SWE-bench Verified benchmarks but underperforms on Codeforces, GPQA Diamond, and MMLU assessments.

## Accessibility

Free chat interface supports 50 daily messages. API pricing costs "$0.55 per million input tokens" and "$2.19 per million output tokens" versus OpenAI's "$15 per million input" and "$60 per million output."

## Limitations

The model adheres to Chinese censorship policies and "core socialist values," avoiding sensitive geopolitical questions.

## Key Lessons

- Cost-effective alternatives can challenge market leaders
- Open-source models democratize AI access for independent builders

## Tech Stack

- HuggingFace (distribution platform)
- MIT License (open source)
