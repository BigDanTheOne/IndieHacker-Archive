The piece profiles Clark Johnson, a 94-year-old physicist and inventor with a seven-decade career spanning 3M, HDTV development, and cutting-edge data storage innovation.

Around 2000, Johnson, Solomon, and Eric Rosenthal (formerly at Disney Imagineering) discovered Gabriel Lippmann's century-old color photography technique. Lippmann's method used silver halide emulsion on glass plates to capture the full light spectrum through standing waves -- far superior to traditional RGB photography. This discovery sparked their innovation: adapting Lippmann's durable photographic process for digital data storage.

The team developed Standing-Wave Storage (SWS) technology -- a "write once, read forever" system requiring virtually zero maintenance energy. The modified Lippmann plate stores up to four superimposed colors per pixel across 10-square-micrometer pixels, achieving 4.6 terabits of capacity per 10.16 x 12.7 cm plate -- equivalent to 300+ movies. Writing uses LED arrays; reading employs CCD cameras identical to those in smartphones. The system proved immune to cosmic rays during nine months aboard the International Space Station in 2019, with zero data degradation.

The team holds six patents for SWS technology and established Wave Domain in Monson, Massachusetts.

**Revenue Numbers Mentioned:**
- Data center/AI infrastructure market growth: 44% annually
- Estimated archival data in current data centers: ~25%

**Key Lessons:**
1. Institutional support fosters innovation: "You could spend 15 percent of your time working on things you liked"
2. Serendipitous knowledge synthesis across disciplines enables breakthrough discoveries
3. Durability trumps convenience for archival storage needs
4. At 94, Johnson recognizes when to pass leadership rather than force commercialization

**Tech Stack Mentioned:**
- Silver halide emulsion with hardened gelatin coating
- LED array for writing
- CCD camera arrays for reading
