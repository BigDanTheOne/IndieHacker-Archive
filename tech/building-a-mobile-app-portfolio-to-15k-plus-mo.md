Sebastian Rohl discovered Indie Hackers in 2019 while finishing university and was inspired by founders sharing business details. After three years as a software engineer seeking creative freedom, he left his job in 2022 to pursue indie hacking. With limited traction after a year, he returned to employment and developed apps as a side project. By February 2024, his apps generated sufficient revenue to support him full-time again.

Rohl manages three mobile applications across iOS and Android:
- **HabitKit**: A minimalist habit tracker displaying consistency in GitHub-style grids. Reached $15k monthly revenue in November 2024 and continues growing.
- **Liftbear**: His first app, born from weightlifting passion.
- **WinDiary**: Designed to help remember personal achievements.

His initial product, Liftbear, developed over six months, gained no traction. Reflecting on failures, Rohl pursued a different idea with HabitKit, imposing a strict two-month deadline for the first version. He built publicly on Twitter, sharing development screenshots, requesting feedback, and rapidly implementing suggestions.

The business model employs freemium mechanics across all applications. HabitKit offers monthly subscriptions, yearly plans, and one-time lifetime purchases. January consistently generates the highest revenue as users pursue New Year habit-building.

User acquisition primarily occurs through App Store and Google Play organic discovery. Rohl emphasizes App Store Optimization fundamentals: compelling screenshots, strong titles and subtitles, strategic keywords, and clear descriptions. Twitter serves as his primary marketing channel.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Monthly revenue exceeded $15,000 (achieved November 2024)
- Continues growing beyond stated figures
- January typically provides highest monthly revenue

**Key Lessons:**
- Fast iteration matters: Two-month deadline for HabitKit contrasted sharply with six-month Liftbear development
- Building in public attracts both visibility and motivation
- Freemium with choice: Offering subscriptions alongside lifetime purchases accommodates diverse preferences
- Organic discovery dominates: ASO fundamentals drive most user acquisition
- Patience compounds: Consistent improvement and user feedback eventually accelerate growth
- Learn from failure: Not every product succeeds; learning and moving forward matters

**Tech Stack:**
Flutter (cross-platform iOS/Android), SQLite (local storage), RevenueCat (subscriptions), Appfigures (analytics), Astro (ASO), SwiftUI/SwiftData/iCloud Sync (new iOS-native projects)
