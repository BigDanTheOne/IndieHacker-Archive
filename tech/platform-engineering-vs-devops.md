Gowie opens by emphasizing that "so much of software delivery comes down to 'how are we accurately describing what we're doing?'"

He critiques the DevOps term as being overly broad and ambiguous. According to Gowie, asking ten engineers to define DevOps yields conflicting answers -- some call it a culture, others a job title, and still others describe it as "ops but you're also developing application code."

In contrast, Gowie advocates for "platform engineering" as clearer terminology. He explains: "You have engineers who are building the platform that your software runs on. 'Platform' is the critical word that holds it together and makes the idea make sense."

The core philosophy centers on treating the platform as a product serving application engineers as customers. Gowie states: "Those application engineers are our users. We're trying to serve them." He emphasizes asking questions and ensuring developer satisfaction.

Gowie shares his career transition from TypeScript and Ruby development to Terraform and AWS infrastructure work, noting satisfaction in supporting application engineers as internal users.

## Key Lessons

- Clear terminology matters in software delivery
- Platform engineering provides semantic precision versus the ambiguous "DevOps" label
- Developer experience should drive platform design
- Application engineers are the platform team's primary customers

**Tech Stack:** Terraform, AWS, TypeScript, Ruby, OpenTofu
