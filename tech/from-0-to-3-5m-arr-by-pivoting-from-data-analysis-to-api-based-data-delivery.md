## Founder: Denis Alaev
## Company: EODHD APIs

Denis Alaev founded EODHD APIs, a financial data platform generating $3.5M annually. The company evolved from a 2015 robo-advisory engine into an API-first financial data provider offering real-time and historical market data, fundamentals, forex, cryptocurrency, and economic indicators with global coverage.

## Revenue Numbers

- Monthly recurring revenue: $875,000
- Annual recurring revenue: $3.5M
- Pricing tiers: 19.99-999.99/month
- Deal cycle: 1-8 months

## Growth Timeline

- September 2017: Reached break-even
- February 2018: Became profitable
- Fall 2019: Hired first customer support specialist
- Current: $3-3.5M annual revenue

## The Pivot

Initially conceptualized as a B2C tool for retail investors in 2015, the platform struggled with high customer acquisition costs. In May 2017, Alaev shifted toward API-based data delivery targeting B2B and B2C markets. He posted the concept on a forum Friday evening, built a landing page over the weekend, and acquired his first subscriber ($5/month) by Monday.

## Key Lessons

1. **Action Over Perfectionism**: "Don't overthink -- just take action."
2. **Strategic Pivoting**: Recognizing market viability limitations drove the shift from B2C to B2B API delivery.
3. **Business Model Selection**: Subscription-based recurring revenue proved essential for sustainability.
4. **Organic Growth Foundation**: Community engagement through forums, Quora, Reddit generated initial traction without paid marketing.
5. **Marketing Channel Diversification**: SEO, content academy, developer forums, GitHub repositories, Google Ads, Medium partnerships, and PR outreach.
6. **Early Delegation**: Hiring sooner would have accelerated growth.
7. **Long-term B2B Focus**: Enterprise clients represent higher-value opportunities.
