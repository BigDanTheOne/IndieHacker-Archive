Joseph Lee, founder and CEO of Supademo, transitioned from the food distribution industry to build an AI-native demo automation platform. The company helps organizations create interactive product demonstrations for onboarding, sales, marketing, and training purposes.

Lee's entrepreneurial background spans multiple ventures. Before Supademo, he built Freshline.io (an e-commerce platform for perishables) and Coastline Market (a predictive seafood marketplace), each reaching seven-figure revenues.

The inspiration emerged from personal frustration. While operating his food distribution business, Lee struggled to explain complex product features to non-technical audiences. Traditional approaches—slide decks and videos—proved resource-intensive and required constant updates.

Development began with a screenshot-based approach targeting a narrow customer segment. The team iteratively expanded features—adding guided workflows, videos, and HTML steps—to reach the current product offering.

Supademo operates as a freemium, product-led SaaS platform with self-serve distribution. Growth primarily stems from virality and word-of-mouth generated through the free tier, supplemented by organizational expansion.

The company's growth strategy rests on four pillars: product craftsmanship, lean product-led experimentation, SEO and content marketing, and product-led virality. For SEO, the team implements programmatic top-of-funnel strategies, middle-of-funnel pages targeting "{product} demo" searches, and comparison pages. LinkedIn thought leadership expanded reach from 10,000 to over 500,000 impressions quarterly.

Virality mechanics include ungating the entire platform, offering free tools like a screenshot editor, implementing reverse trials with full Scale plan access without signup, and rapid A/B testing on watermarks.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Mid-7-figure ARR (>$300K monthly)
- 3x growth in current year
- 8x growth in 2024
- Thousands of paying customers
- 100,000+ users

**Key Lessons:**
- "You'll learn faster by doing than by analyzing"
- Don't confuse motion with progress; focus on selling or building
- Identify lived friction to validate real problems
- Product-led virality through ungating and free tools drives sustainable growth
- Ship quickly on established intervals to maintain momentum
