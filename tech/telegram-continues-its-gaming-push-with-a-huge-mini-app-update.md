Telegram, with 950 million monthly active users, is the fourth most popular messaging app globally and receives more downloads than any competitor. The platform aims to become an "everything" app similar to WeChat, combining messaging, payments (primarily cryptocurrency), and gaming capabilities.

Telegram's gaming features, called mini apps, have gained significant traction. The company recently released what it describes as the "largest update in the history of mini apps," introducing:

- Full-screen mode functionality
- Media sharing capabilities with referral code integration
- Device motion tracking for motion-controlled games and VR experiences
- Home screen shortcuts for favorite mini apps
- Geolocation access for location-based gaming
- Subscription monetization options
- Gift reward systems for player progression
- Downloadable documents and AI-generated content

**Revenue Numbers Mentioned:**
- Players spent over $100 billion on in-game purchases last year

**Key Lessons:**
Mobile gaming represents an enormous market opportunity. Messaging platforms with established user bases provide built-in distribution advantages. Expanding beyond core functionality into gaming can drive engagement and monetization.
