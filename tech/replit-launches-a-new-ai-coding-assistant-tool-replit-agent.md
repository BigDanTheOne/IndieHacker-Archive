Replit has released Replit Agent, positioned as "the world's best AI software engineer." Available through Replit Core ($25/month) and Replit Teams ($40/month), the tool automates development tasks including environment setup, package installation, database configuration, code writing, and deployment.

User demonstrations include:
1. A Python novice built a sentiment analyzer in 23 minutes with 8 interactions
2. A developer created a Wordle clone in 2:43 minutes
3. A complete programming beginner constructed a 3D platforming game

## Revenue Numbers

- Replit Core: $25/month
- Replit Teams: $40/month

## Key Lessons
