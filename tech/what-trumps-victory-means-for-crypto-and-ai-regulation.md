On November 6, 2024, Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, and the technology industry significantly contributed to his victory.

## Cryptocurrency Regulatory Outlook

The crypto industry invested heavily in the election cycle, spending over $100 million supporting pro-crypto candidates across Congress and the presidency. Notably, they allocated $40 million specifically to unseat Senator Sherrod Brown, a vocal crypto opponent.

Trump's position on cryptocurrency has shifted dramatically. Previously skeptical, he now positions himself as the crypto president with pledges to:
- Preserve government bitcoin holdings
- Establish a national bitcoin strategic reserve
- Remove SEC Chair Gary Gensler on day one
- Create a presidential crypto advisory council
- Ensure future bitcoin mining occurs in America

## AI Regulatory Environment

Trump plans to repeal Biden's AI Executive Order emphasizing safety and security, replacing it with one prioritizing military AI advancement and deregulation. This would eliminate the U.S. AI Safety Institute and training methodology reporting requirements.

A key uncertainty involves Elon Musk's influence, as "he is not a typical Trump voter when it comes to AI regulation" despite being a major Trump supporter who backs regulatory frameworks.

Additional variables include proposed tariffs on imports and H-1B visa restrictions, which could impact GPU supply and talent availability.

**Key Data Points:**
- $100M+: Crypto industry spending on pro-crypto candidate campaigns
- $40M: Spending to unseat Senator Sherrod Brown

**Key Themes:**
1. Tech industry influence on election outcomes
2. Regulatory capture concerns in deregulated markets
3. Concentration of power among major technology companies
4. Tension between innovation acceleration and oversight
