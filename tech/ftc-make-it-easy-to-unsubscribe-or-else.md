The US Federal Trade Commission ratified a "click-to-cancel" rule requiring subscription providers to make cancellation as straightforward as signup. FTC Chair Lina Khan stated: "Too often, businesses make people jump through endless hoops just to cancel a subscription." This regulation carries substantial implications for the software industry.

President Biden emphasized consumer protection, noting that citizens shouldn't worry about being deceived into unwanted subscriptions or trapped within them.

## Key Lessons

- Businesses have been using dark patterns to frustrate cancellation attempts
- The rule applies across industries (software, gyms, retailers)
- Implementation requirements: website/app signups must allow cancellation through the same channel; phone or online options required for in-person enrollments
- Chatbots or customer service agents cannot be mandatory for cancellation
