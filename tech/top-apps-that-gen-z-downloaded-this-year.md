AppFigures released a report on the most downloaded mobile applications by Gen Z (ages 18-24) in 2024. The analysis revealed three notable trends:

1. **Temu** claimed the #1 position as a competitive online marketplace alternative to Amazon.

2. **Short drama apps** are experiencing rapid growth. ShortMax, one of the fastest-growing platforms in this category, achieved over 10 million installations among the 18-24 demographic during 2024.

3. **AI-powered educational tools** gained significant traction. Gauth, a homework assistance application created by ByteDance (TikTok's parent company), experienced notable download surge earlier in the year.

**Key Lessons:**
One commenter identified an overarching pattern: "high rewards for low effort." The apps reflect Gen Z preferences for gamified experiences (Temu), convenient entertainment (short dramas), and solutions addressing problems created by the platforms themselves (ByteDance's educational tool).
