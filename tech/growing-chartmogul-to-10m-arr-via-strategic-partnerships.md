Nick Franklin transitioned from being Zendesk's Asia sales director to founding ChartMogul after identifying a market gap. The company provides subscription analytics and a modern CRM designed specifically for B2B SaaS firms.

Franklin initially learned Ruby on Rails and Backbone.js to build an MVP without pre-validation. A competitor's market entry validated demand, prompting his full-time commitment despite lacking revenue.

## Revenue Numbers

- Current ARR: ~$10M (between $8MM-$12MM monthly)
- Initial Seed Round (2014): $600K
- Follow-up Round: $3.1M
- Total Raised: $3.7M (no funding for 7+ years since last round)
- Current Team Size: 67 full-time employees

## Key Lessons

1. **Hiring Excellence:** Talent quality compounds over time while bad hires create inverse effects
2. **Leadership Involvement:** Leaders should maintain hands-on work participation
3. **Early Growth Channels:** Investor networks (40% early customers), content marketing, partnerships, word-of-mouth
4. **Partnership Strategy:** Actively networked at SaaStr, SaaStock to establish relationships with Stripe, Recurly, Braintree
5. **Sales Philosophy:** Strong sales requires "listening and understanding customer needs"
6. **Ambitious Scaling:** Building a large business requires similar effort to building small ones -- aim higher

**Tech Stack:** Ruby on Rails, Backbone.js, Stripe, Recurly, Braintree, Chargebee, App Store Connect
