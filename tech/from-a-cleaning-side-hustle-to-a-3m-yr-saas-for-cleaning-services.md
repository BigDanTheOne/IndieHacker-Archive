## Founder: Amar Ghose
## Company: ZenMaid

## Key Financial Metrics

- **Current Annual Revenue:** $3 million
- **Monthly Revenue:** $250,000+
- **First Customer Deal:** $1,000 lifetime deal (2013)
- **Time to Profitability:** 6-7 years into the business

## Origin Story

Amar Ghose launched a cleaning service called Fast Friendly Spotless in 2012 while working in Silicon Valley tech sales. After closing it within a year, his friend Arun proposed building software for maid service operators. They founded ZenMaid in 2013.

Neither founder had substantial income initially. They reinvested all revenue for 2.5 years without taking salaries. The founders employed intensive cold outreach: "I sent 20-50 cold emails daily before my day job, making early morning calls to East Coast maid services."

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, React Query
- **Backend:** Ruby on Rails, GraphQL API (migrating from server-side Rails rendering)

## Key Lessons

1. **Firsthand Industry Experience:** Operating a cleaning business provided irreplaceable insights into customer pain points.
2. **Persistence Over Talent:** "The key difference between our success and their failures? They eventually stopped improving their products, marketing, and customer service."
3. **Beginner's Mindset:** Continuous learning across marketing, management, and leadership despite 11 years of operation.
4. **Consistency Over Intensity:** Dedicating 15 minutes to one hour daily to long-term business improvements proves more sustainable than sporadic heroic efforts.
5. **Long-term Marketing Vision:** The company targets six to twelve-month sales cycles while remaining top-of-mind through value creation.
6. **Feature Discipline:** Users may request features they never utilize; validation through actual usage matters more.
