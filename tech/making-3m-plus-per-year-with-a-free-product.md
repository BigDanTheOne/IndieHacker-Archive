Ivan Kutskir created Photopea as a hobby project in 2012, initially spending only 10 hours monthly as a student. The web-based Photoshop alternative remained non-monetized for five years, driven purely by user enthusiasm.

The product launched with minimal features and evolved through consistent monthly updates. Early traction came from Google Experiments (10-20 daily visitors), blog mentions, and organic word-of-mouth sharing. Self-promotional posts on platforms like Reddit were frequently deleted, but later AMAs attracted substantial new users.

The entire application runs in JavaScript and GLSL on users' browsers, eliminating server dependency post-loading. The minimal backend uses PHP for user account databases and PeaDrive cloud storage--both optional features most users skip. Operating costs are approximately $620/year for domain and hosting.

Ads comprise 90% of revenue, with Premium accounts removing advertisements and licensing making up the remaining 10%. Growth directly correlates with user base expansion. Kutskir has remained solo, maximizing enjoyment and decision autonomy.

Kutskir's founding philosophy emphasized creation over commercialization: "I just wanted to create useful (or at least interesting) pieces of software." He advises: "Don't be afraid of making mistakes... Instead of searching for a perfect idea, try multiple ideas."

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $3M+ annual revenue (2024)
- $250K monthly revenue
- ~1M daily active users
- ~$620/year operating costs (domain + hosting)
- Revenue breakdown: 90% ads, 10% Premium/licensing

**Key Lessons:**
- Value-first approach: building for enjoyment rather than monetization enables organic growth
- Solo sustainability: remaining solo maximizes enjoyment and decision autonomy
- Lean infrastructure: minimal operating costs create sustainable profitability
- Launch incomplete products: enables continuous iteration and market feedback
- Gut decisions: declining acquisition offers when something feels wrong preserves long-term autonomy

**Tech Stack:**
JavaScript, GLSL (frontend, runs entirely in browser), PHP (minimal backend for accounts/cloud storage)
