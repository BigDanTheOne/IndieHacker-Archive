Josef Buttgen, founder of Setter AI, shares his journey from nearly exhausting his startup runway to achieving $10,000 MRR in just over a year.

Buttgen taught himself coding at age 13 and studied Computer Science formally. Facing desperation over diminishing runway, he committed to launching twelve startups within twelve months. During month three, a friend contacted him about a sales software concept already partially validated with a landing page and booked demo calls despite lacking a functional product.

Setter AI is a B2B SaaS platform enabling businesses to qualify and follow up with leads faster, booking appointments automatically. Rather than spending months building custom AI voice, Buttgen pivoted to leveraging existing APIs. This allowed the team to ship and sell their first prototype within two weeks.

Growth channels: organic SEO and email marketing consistently deliver high-quality customers. Content marketing focuses on listicles, statistics pages, and comparison articles.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $10,000 MRR
- $120,000 ARR (run rate)
- Goal: $1,000,000 ARR

**Key Lessons:**
- Speed over perfection: Shipping in two weeks proved more valuable than months of development
- "Create noise first, then you can think" -- action precedes clarity
- Validate before building: Pre-launch landing page with booked demos proved the model
- Business differs from software engineering: Developers must unlearn perfectionism
- Constraint breeds clarity: Dwindling runway forced prioritization

**Tech Stack:**
SvelteKit, Supabase, DaisyUI, Clerk, Netlify Functions
