Rob Hallam, founder of SuperX, shares his journey from unemployment through five failed product attempts to building a successful SaaS platform for X (Twitter) growth.

After being laid off from his corporate job, Rob spent 2.5 years attempting to build products online without success. He continued sharing his work on X despite the failures. One viral post about his struggles gained 200,000 views, prompting someone to suggest he start a dev agency. He launched it immediately and began receiving inbound clients exclusively from his X posts.

Recognizing that social media distribution was his competitive advantage, Rob partnered with Tibo Louis-Lucas, who had acquired a Chrome extension called SuperX. Rob rebuilt the entire product from scratch into a web application, despite significant challenges including hospitalization twice during development and repeated X API changes.

The platform launched in July 2025 and reached $1,000 MRR on day one. Within six months, SuperX achieved $23,000 monthly recurring revenue with approximately 650 paying customers at $39 monthly, experiencing 20-25% month-over-month growth.

**Growth Strategy:** Rob emphasizes consistent daily video posting following a three-part loop: entertaining/vulnerable content for attention, educational or product demos while audience watches, then results and inspiration. He systematically studies viral content in his niche to reverse-engineer successful posting patterns. Video content generates 10x more reach than text posts.

**Key Insights Shared:**
- "Distribution from day one" prevented the failures of his first five ventures
- Consistency compounds—he grew from 900 to 40,000 followers through daily posting
- Approximately 95% of users came from organic growth versus paid advertising
- Only $5,000 total spent on ads
- Public accountability through sharing struggles kept him motivated

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $0 total earnings from five previous product attempts
- $3,000 from first dev agency client
- $1,000 MRR on SuperX launch day (July 2025)
- $23,000 current MRR
- 650 paying customers at $39/month
- $2,000-$3,000/month X API costs
- $5,000 total advertising spend
- Target: $100,000 MRR

**Key Lessons:**
- Distribution is the growth engine—product alone insufficient without audience
- Validate demand before building; ask people to pay first
- Post with intention using data-driven patterns rather than randomly
- Video content dramatically outperforms text on social platforms
- Consistency matters more than individual post performance
- Building publicly creates accountability and audience investment
