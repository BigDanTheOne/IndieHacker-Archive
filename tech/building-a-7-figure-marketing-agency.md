David Ly Khim co-founded Omniscient Digital with Alex Birkett and Allie Konchar while employed at HubSpot. The cofounders had previously worked at HubSpot, Shopify, and Workato, building organic growth programs. The agency serves B2B software companies, from startups to enterprises, with both project-based and retainer-based services.

Khim reached mid-six figures while building part-time, then transitioned to full-time. The agency now generates mid-seven figures annually. Primary attribution sources include Google, referrals, ChatGPT, and LinkedIn.

Khim advocates a GEO Framework (Generative Engine Optimization) for modern marketing: be the source by creating on-site content crawled by LLMs, influence the source by getting mentioned on frequently-cited pages, and replace the source by producing superior content to displace existing sources. The company appears in LLM outputs for relevant searches.

The agency prioritizes AI and automation systems before hiring, allowing teams to focus on high-impact work rather than tedious tasks. When scaling, Khim prioritizes hiring people "who care" about excellent work, with culture enforcement from leadership to prevent mediocrity.

For enterprise clients, he advises understanding procurement and legal requirements and setting clear boundaries on terms and pricing.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Mid-seven figures annually (>$83K/month)
- Reached mid-six figures while building part-time before going full-time
- Goal: double seven-figure revenue within 1-2 years while maintaining strong profit margins

**Key Lessons:**
- "Build something on the side during your nights and weekends" before quitting your job
- Automation-first approach: prioritize AI and automation systems before hiring
- Build your own marketing engine: invest in SEO, content marketing, podcasts, LinkedIn, and events
- GEO Framework: be the source, influence the source, replace the source
- Talk directly with target customers about your offering for validation
- When scaling, prioritize hiring people who care about excellent work
