Samuel Rondot transitioned from working as an optician in France to building a profitable SaaS portfolio. His journey began with side projects built before and after work, driven by a desire for physical freedom.

His first business, MathPlanner, was an Instagram automation service that didn't require coding. Instead, workers in India and Bangladesh performed tasks behind a WordPress landing page. Despite its simplicity, it grew to approximately $30,000 monthly revenue, enabling him to quit his job.

Currently, Rondot manages three main products:

- **StoryShort.ai**: approximately $20,000/month (generates short faceless videos from text)
- **UseArtemis.co**: approximately $5,000/month (LinkedIn automation, declining due to platform restrictions)
- **Capacity.so**: approximately $3,000/month and growing (AI website builder built with a high school friend)

**Core Philosophy**: Rondot emphasizes that freedom and the desire to build things motivated his entrepreneurial path more than financial goals initially. He loves watching revenue graphs increase and experiencing the energy of products gaining traction.

**Learning to Code**: Rondot acknowledges his biggest early challenge was not knowing how to code. He struggled with WordPress plugins and found customization painful. Learning programming changed everything by providing freedom to build whatever he envisioned. While he recommends others still learn to code for understanding, he notes that AI tools could significantly accelerate MVP development if starting fresh today.

**Growth Channels**: Rondot follows a consistent two-pronged approach:

1. **SEO**: Described as "the best long-term driver of business growth." It requires patience but compounds over time, becoming the strongest channel after six months of investment.

2. **Paid Advertising**: Primarily Meta and Google ads provide predictable, scalable SaaS traffic for validation and growth.

**Strategic Positioning**: Recognizing that most competitors have raised funding, Rondot chose different battlegrounds. He focuses on YouTube videos, SEO optimization, and AI engine optimization to accumulate approximately 400 daily clicks. He deliberately shifted away from paid advertising after discovering competitors were willing to spend $200 to acquire a $30 customer.

**Validation Framework**: Before building anything, Rondot validates by examining search volume for keywords, SEO metrics, competitor strength and strategies, distribution methods competitors use, and actual demand signals. His critical advice: "If you can't clearly see the path to money, don't build it."

**Revenue Numbers:**
- MathPlanner (initial business): ~$30,000/month
- StoryShort.ai: ~$20,000/month
- UseArtemis.co: ~$5,000/month
- Capacity.so: ~$3,000/month (growing)
- Total Portfolio: $28,000/month

**Key Lessons:**
- Validate demand before building; checking search volume prevents wasted development
- Simple tech stacks enable faster shipping and iteration
- SEO compounds over time and becomes the strongest long-term channel
- Choose distribution channels you can compete in rather than matching funded competitors
- "If you can't clearly see the path to money, don't build it"
- Multiple products diversify risk compared to betting everything on one solution

**Tech Stack:**
Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Vercel, AWS
