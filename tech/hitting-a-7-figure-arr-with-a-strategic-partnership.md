Eugene Zolotarenko, a software engineer, began building products in his spare time while working as a front-end developer. His initial success came from a Chat with PDF tool during the AI boom, which generated $3,000 monthly recurring revenue. This led him to explore SEO and content creation, sparking the idea for Outrank.

He launched Outrank's first version but struggled to gain traction, reaching only $400 monthly revenue despite promotion efforts. The product needed better execution and stronger market reach.

The turning point came when Zolotarenko messaged Tibo on X (formerly Twitter). The two discussed the application and decided to partner. Together, they completely reshaped the product, rebuilt it, renamed it, and relaunched it as Outrank.

Post-partnership, the business transformed dramatically. With improved customer retention and Tibo's marketing expertise, the team aggressively promoted on X and quickly reached $10,000 monthly revenue. This milestone enabled Zolotarenko to leave his stable job and focus entirely on the product.

Zolotarenko emphasizes that the product itself represents the most valuable asset. He credits customer listening and feedback as essential to building a sticky product that users genuinely want.

Distribution proved to be the primary challenge throughout development. The team employed multiple channels:
- X and newsletter content
- Product Hunt launches
- An affiliate program
- SEO strategies (dogfooding Outrank itself, creating content, building backlinks through their marketplace, and developing free tools)
- Paid advertising

Zolotarenko highlights the power of having an existing audience, which significantly accelerated Outrank's growth trajectory.

His core advice to aspiring founders includes persistent experimentation across marketing channels, strategic partnerships with complementary builders, genuine customer relationships, and building products refined through user feedback.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $3,000 MRR (Chat with PDF product)
- $400 MRR (initial Outrank launch)
- $10,000 MRR (after partnership)
- $83,000+ per month (current revenue)
- 7-figure ARR (approximately $1.2 million+ annually)

**Key Lessons:**
- Distribution over product perfection: A well-distributed adequate product outperforms an undiscovered excellent one
- Strategic partnerships accelerate growth: Finding a cofounder with complementary skills transformed the business
- Customer feedback drives stickiness: Listening to users creates products people genuinely want
- Multi-channel approach works: Layering X engagement, SEO, affiliates, Product Hunt, and paid ads creates compounding visibility

**Tech Stack:**
Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS
