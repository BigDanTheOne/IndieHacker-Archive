Andrew Gazdecki, a lifelong entrepreneur from San Clemente, grew up in modest circumstances, which motivated him to create his own path rather than work for others. Before founding Acquire.com, he had three successful exits, including bootstrapping Bizness Apps (a mobile app platform) to $10M in annual recurring revenue before selling to a private equity firm in 2017.

## The Problem

Despite media coverage suggesting acquisitions were straightforward transactions between large companies and founders, the reality proved far more complex. Most acquisitions were "laborious, time-consuming, and suffered poor success rates." Gazdecki observed an imbalance of power among buyers, sellers, and intermediaries.

## The Solution: Acquire.com

Gazdecki created a startup acquisition marketplace combining technology with M&A advisory support. Acquirers pay annual subscription fees while sellers pay monthly listing fees plus closing fees (6-8%) only upon successful sale.

Validation came through speaking with hundreds of founders, then launching an MVP on Product Hunt. He solved the chicken-and-egg problem with cold outreach to founders to build initial seller base.

## Revenue Numbers

- $500M+ in closed deals since 2020 launch
- $10M ARR (Bizness Apps, before 2017 exit)
- 1,000+ startups acquired through platform
- 6-8% closing fee for sellers

## Key Lessons

1. Don't invest everything into your first business -- sell while profitable and use experience for larger ventures
2. Prioritize good-enough over perfection
3. Keep costs low -- work solo or find complementary cofounders
4. Focus on solving problems before chasing funding
5. Put in the work -- no shortcuts exist
6. Know your customer's language -- develop resonant marketing stories based on lived experience

## Strategic Vision

Gazdecki aims to make Acquire.com "the Zillow of M&A," positioning it as the first resource founders consider when selling SaaS businesses.
