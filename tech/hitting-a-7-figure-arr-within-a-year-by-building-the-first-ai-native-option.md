Madhu Nadig founded Flagright, an AI-native anti-money laundering (AML) compliance platform serving financial institutions. The platform comprises transaction monitoring with no-code rule builders, centralized case management, AML screening, customer risk scoring, and AI Forensics capabilities.

Nadig's cofounder, a Product Director at a financial institution, spent 18 months searching for real-time transaction monitoring tools only to encounter vendors who "overpromised and underdelivered." This gap inspired the founding vision, combining the cofounder's compliance expertise with Nadig's background at Palantir and AWS building large-scale systems.

A fortuitous connection through the cofounder's network landed their first pilot customer--a large fintech company--which validated the concept and contributed to Y Combinator acceptance. The team launched in November 2021 targeting early-stage startups neglected by enterprise-only vendors. They leveraged the Y Combinator network through direct outreach with product demos and usage-based pricing aligned with startup runways, achieving eight customer signatures by June 2022.

The team applied engineering discipline to GTM, executing "tight ICP slices, small outbound batches, and weekly copy tweaks" that converted product launches into social proof. Content strategy focused on compliance teardowns and live engineering webinars addressing practitioner questions. After establishing the startup beachhead, they systematically expanded upmarket: neobanks to BaaS platforms to crypto on/off-ramps to traditional banks to insurers to wealth managers. The playbook remained consistent: "Find an ignored pocket, win three reference logos, publish their results."

Being a second-mover enabled embedding AI from day one. Early OpenAI access through Y Combinator accelerated experimentation, positioning Flagright as the first compliance vendor with deeply integrated generative AI across the platform. The platform achieved 90%+ false-positive reduction compared to legacy systems and 80% decrease in alert investigation time.

Integration simplicity became a competitive moat: just six API endpoints from launch, with average integration time of one week and fastest at 2.5 days. Flexible, component-based pricing allowed customers to purchase only needed features, reducing decision friction while enabling expansion revenue.

Current reach spans 50+ countries, handling real-time card processing and unit-trust redemptions globally.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- 7-figure ARR (>$83K per month) achieved within one year of launch
- Revenue has doubled every twelve months since
- 8 customers signed within first 6 months
- 90%+ false-positive reduction vs. legacy systems
- 80% decrease in alert investigation time

**Key Lessons:**
- "Treat go-to-market like an engineering system. Track it, measure it, optimize it."
- Simplify integration: maintain minimal API endpoints, target sub-two-week integrations
- Being second-mover enables embedding AI from day one rather than retrofitting
- Modularity drives sales and retention: component-based pricing reduces friction
- "If we were starting over, I'd think about distribution and marketing from day one"
- Find ignored pockets, win three reference logos, publish their results

**Tech Stack:**
Node.js, Python, Go (backend), React with custom design system (frontend), stream processing, granular RBAC, multi-tenant isolation
