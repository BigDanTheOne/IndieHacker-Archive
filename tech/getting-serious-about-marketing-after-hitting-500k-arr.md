David Bressler developed Formula Bot, an AI-powered analytics platform enabling users to upload files and "chat with their data" for insights, charts, and analysis. He built the initial MVP on paternity leave using no-code tools, achieving viral growth on Reddit before formal marketing efforts.

Bressler built the MVP in one week using Bubble.io and OpenAI APIs, launching as a free Excel formula generator. The product went viral on Reddit's /InternetIsBeautiful subreddit with over 1M views. He then pivoted to a subscription model after viral success created unsustainable API costs. Growth stagnated mid-2023 through 2024 before Bressler recommitted to intentional marketing in 2025.

He launched without login requirements (accidentally) and no API limits--this friction-free experience drove adoption but created operational challenges. Later, consolidating 30 buttons into a single chat interface improved conversion rates by 45%.

Growth strategies include SEO via free tools (PDF-to-Excel, SQL generators, formula builders), user office hours (3-5 weekly calls for direct feedback), UI simplification, educational YouTube content, Google Ads with a 7-month breakeven target, and paid influencer partnerships.

Bressler maintains a bootstrapped, lifestyle-focused approach: "quality family time, few vacations a year, ride bikes to drop off and pick up my kids, work out several times a week, low stress."

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $500,000+ ARR
- $42,000+ monthly revenue
- Over 1 million email addresses
- 20% MRR growth YTD from increased marketing focus
- Subscription pricing: $15-$35/month
- 99.9% revenue from subscriptions

**Key Lessons:**
- "Most of your users don't know your competitors. If they offer something that you don't or if they have more competitive pricing, don't fixate on it."
- Friction-free onboarding drives adoption but can create operational challenges
- Consolidating complex UI into simple chat interface improved conversion by 45%
- Free tools as SEO strategy: formula builders, PDF converters rank highly
- User office hours (3-5 weekly calls) provide invaluable direct feedback

**Tech Stack:**
Bubble.io (backend/frontend), OpenAI, Gemini (AI models), AWS S3 (file storage), N8N (external API data retrieval), Brevo (email), Render/GitHub (Python script execution)
