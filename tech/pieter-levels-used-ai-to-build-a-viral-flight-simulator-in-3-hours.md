Pieter Levels created a 3D browser-based flight simulator in just three hours using the Cursor AI coding tool, despite having zero game development experience. Within seven days, the project went viral following an Elon Musk retweet, survived a DDOS attack, and began generating revenue through premium features.

## Timeline of Development

- Day 1 (Feb 22): Initial concept to playable prototype in 3 hours
- Same evening: Added shooting mechanics, mobile controls, and explosion effects
- Following days: Implemented multiplayer functionality using PeerJS/WebRTC and Python WebSocket server
- Feb 26: Elon Musk retweeted the project, calling it "cool" and predicting "AI gaming will be massive"
- Feb 27: Added F-16 jet microtransactions ($29.99)
- During peak: Project survived 120-million-request DDOS attack

## Revenue Numbers

Initial metrics (within 7 days):
- 89,000 total players; 26,000 concurrent at peak
- 9 F-16 jets sold @ $29.99 = ~$270
- 1 advertising blimp @ $1,000
- Total: $1,270

Updated metrics (3 days later):
- 19 blimps sold at various prices = $38,000/month
- 12 F-16s @ $29.99 = ~$360
- Total: $38,360/month

## Tech Stack

Development Tools:
- Cursor (primary coding tool)
- Grok 3 (backend/API)
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet (AI assistance)
- ChatGPT (debugging)

Frameworks and Libraries:
- Three.js (3D graphics)
- PeerJS (peer-to-peer multiplayer via WebRTC)
- WebSockets (real-time player synchronization)
- nippleJS (mobile joystick controls)
- Stripe (payment processing)

Core Technology: Vanilla HTML and JavaScript

## Key Lessons

1. **Speed trumps polish:** Levels demonstrated that shipping quickly with AI assistance beats traditional, lengthy development cycles.

2. **Distribution matters as much as product:** Going viral required existing audience credibility; the game's success relied on his established following and Musk's amplification.

3. **Programming foundation essential:** Despite AI capabilities, basic coding knowledge was necessary to guide tool output effectively and solve integration problems.

4. **Monetization readiness:** Levels capitalized on virality immediately, proving demand exists for cosmetic upgrades in simple web games.

5. **Community backlash is real:** Professional game developers criticized the low-quality product receiving premium pricing, highlighting tensions in AI-assisted creation.
