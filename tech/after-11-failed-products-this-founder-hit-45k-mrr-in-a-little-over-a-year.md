Iuliia Shnai transitioned from academia to startups in 2019, launching an EdTech product that ultimately failed after raising pre-seed funding. She spent considerable time pursuing investor meetings rather than sustainable growth strategies. Following this setback in late 2022, she committed to daily social media posting and discovered indie hacking.

In 2023, Shnai built 10 products rapidly. One project--a LinkedIn post generator called Postli--gained viral traction alongside Marc's Papermark launch, an open-source Docsend alternative. Both reached $500 monthly recurring revenue simultaneously, though Postli could not maintain momentum. Shnai joined Papermark full-time in January 2024, focusing on growth initiatives.

Shnai emphasizes "building for growth"--creating micro tools, comparison pages, and content-driven approaches. The company developed approximately 1,000 content pages focusing on bottom-of-funnel articles targeting users actively seeking solutions. She notes: "If your product is an alternative to some existing product, USE THAT. Write about it."

Pricing evolved from a $29/month single plan to a range from free tier through $349/month, with $79/month being the most popular plan. Higher-tier customers demonstrate longer retention.

Two founders with distinct roles (product vs. growth) accelerated progress. Shnai rejected ineffective cold sales that clashed with her skills, focusing instead on content and SEO where she excelled.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $45,000 MRR (approximately one year after joining full-time)
- $1,000 MRR in January 2024
- $500 MRR initial milestone for both Postli and Papermark
- Goal: $1,000,000 ARR by year-end
- Pricing range: free tier through $349/month
- Most popular plan: $79/month

**Key Lessons:**
- "Building has never been easier than now. Typically people wait too long."
- Prioritize growth investments: balance product development with marketing and conversion optimization
- Build publicly: social media engagement helps identify opportunities and reduces isolation
- Align work with personal strengths rather than forcing ineffective methods
- "Why would you aim for independence and building your own thing if it isn't fun?"
- Two founders with distinct roles (product vs. growth) accelerate progress

**Tech Stack:**
Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Vercel, Railway, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL, NextAuth.js, Tinybird (analytics), Resend (email), Stripe (payments), open source on GitHub
