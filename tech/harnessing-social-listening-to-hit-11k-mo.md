Kyle Gawley has spent 15 years building products and startups since 2011. His primary venture, a SaaS boilerplate called Gravity, generates $11,000 monthly in revenue. He's recently launched Alertly, a social-listening application focused on customer discovery, which reached $400 MRR within weeks of opening to the public.

Gawley created Gravity accidentally in 2018 when testing product concepts. He built a UI kit for rapid prototyping that eventually expanded into a full backend system. He posted about it on Indie Hackers and acquired three customers within months.

Alertly emerged from Gawley's own operational challenges. He had been manually monitoring social networks for keywords like "saas boilerplate" to identify conversation opportunities and generate leads.

**Product Validation Strategy**

Gawley emphasizes getting paid before construction begins. For Alertly, he implemented a waitlist combined with an option for early-access founding members willing to pay for the first month upfront. Seven customers prepaid during the first week, validating market demand before significant development.

**Growth Mechanisms:**
- Audience Building: Substantial investment in X and LinkedIn communities
- SEO: Remains crucial despite AI claims of irrelevance
- Social Listening: Monitoring platforms for buyer-problem keywords, buyer-intent keywords, and industry-specific keywords

**Keyword Categories for Social Listening:**
Problem-focused keywords capture people articulating challenges. Intent keywords identify individuals actively considering solutions. Industry keywords maintain visibility within broader ecosystem conversations.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Gravity: $11,000 MRR
- Alertly: $400 MRR (early stage)
- Seven founding members prepaid during first validation week

**Key Lessons:**
- "The only way to validate demand is to get people to pay before it's built"
- Use familiar technology stacks: Proficiency accelerates development
- Social listening drives qualified leads across three keyword categories
- Limit social media consumption while maintaining strategic distribution
- Diversify offerings across time: Build complementary products over 5-7 year cycles
- Build real-world support networks; online communities cannot replace in-person relationships
- Expect multi-year timelines

**Tech Stack:**
Node.js, React, MySQL, Handlebars and jQuery (Gravity v1)
