Meta announced new advertising capabilities, including AI-powered video tools and partnership features designed to help advertisers reach audiences more effectively.

The company released Video Expansion, which generates additional pixels to adjust video aspect ratios automatically. A second tool, Image Animation, converts static images into video content. These complement Meta's existing AI advertising suite, which over 1 million advertisers used to create 15 million ads last month.

Partnership advertising features received significant enhancements. Advertisers can now upload creator images or videos as featured assets in collection ads, add creator testimonials to partnership ads, and access a centralized Partnership Ads Hub.

Meta's advertising algorithm is "widely considered to be the best in the world," with AI making quality ads accessible to more advertisers. The author suggests that crowded traditional marketing channels may make paid advertising increasingly attractive for indie hackers.

## Key Numbers

- AI-enhanced campaigns showed 7.6% higher conversion rates
- Partnership ads achieved 11.8% higher conversion rate versus carousel-only ads
- Partnership ads had 9.6% lower cost-per-conversion
- Over 1 million advertisers used Meta's AI tools to create 15 million ads last month

## Key Lessons

- AI-enhanced advertising tools are democratizing access to high-quality campaigns
- Partnership/creator content drives measurably better performance
- Paid advertising may become more attractive as organic channels become crowded
