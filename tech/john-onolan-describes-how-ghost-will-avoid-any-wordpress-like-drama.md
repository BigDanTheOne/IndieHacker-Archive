Ghost competes directly with WordPress but employs fundamentally different operational strategies. Following WordPress's recent public conflict, Ghost's CEO outlined how the platform will sidestep similar governance issues.

## The WordPress Controversy

WordPress powers 43.6% of all websites globally. While the software itself is open-source, hosting requires either self-management or third-party providers. Automattic (operated by founder Matt Mullenweg) and WP Engine represent the dominant hosting options.

In September, Mullenweg published criticism of WP Engine, characterizing it as damaging to WordPress and accusing it of inadequate open-source contributions. WP Engine responded with legal threats, escalating into a damaging public dispute involving resignations and reputational harm.

## Ghost's Background

Founder John O'Nolan, formerly a WordPress core contributor, launched Ghost in 2013 after becoming frustrated with WordPress's complexity and internal conflicts. Following two Y Combinator rejections, he raised $350,000 through Kickstarter with co-founder Hannah Wolfe.

## Governance Model

Ghost operates as a non-profit open-source initiative. Crucially, "neither O'Nolan or Wolfe own any shares, assets, domains, trademarks, or other companies related to Ghost." The platform "exists for-purpose, rather than for-profit."

To maintain accountability as the organization expands toward 50 employees, O'Nolan plans expanding Board of Trustees membership beyond himself and Wolfe, ensuring diverse perspectives and preventing individual control.

## Revenue Numbers

- Annual revenue: Over $7.5 million
- Founding capital raised: $350,000 (Kickstarter)
- Current team size: Over 30 employees

## Key Lessons

1. Non-profit structural design prevents profit-driven conflicts
2. Decentralized governance distributes power and accountability
3. Publishing-focused specialization avoids bloat present in generalist platforms
4. Transparency regarding ownership eliminates hidden incentive conflicts
