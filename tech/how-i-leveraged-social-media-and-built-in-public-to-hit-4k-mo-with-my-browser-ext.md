Erwin Lengkeek learned coding at age 12 and created various projects including Minecraft plugins and a ringtone sales site. After university consulting work and freelancing in Bali, he pursued indie hacking full-time.

His first venture, Sparkly (2019), reached $300 MRR matching coworkers by interests but collapsed when major customer Walmart churned. Second product, Base Styles branding platform, failed entirely with only 100 trial users across 10 months.

Tailscan emerged as a solution to his own frustration -- switching between code editor and browser while building Tailwind websites. He challenged himself to build and release in four weeks, posting Twitter demos that achieved viral traction. The initial Product Hunt launch converted 40 yearly license customers.

Strategic improvements included adding monthly subscription options and perpetual licenses, boosting MRR from $600 to $2,000. Feature development prioritized user requests: CSS-to-Tailwind conversion, Chrome DevTools integration, and planned Firefox support.

## Revenue Numbers

- Sparkly: ~$300 MRR before churn
- Initial Tailscan launch: ~40 yearly customers at $39 each
- After six months: $600 MRR
- Post-pricing changes: $2,000 MRR
- Current: $4,000-$6,000/month average

## Key Lessons

1. Sharing development progress on social media generated significant traction -- 70,000 impressions and 500 likes on an early demo with only 300 followers
2. Pre-launch newsletter building and consistent demo sharing created audience momentum
3. Major feature additions emerged directly from user feedback
4. Transitioning from yearly-only to monthly and perpetual licenses dramatically increased revenue
5. SEO became responsible for 70-80% of traffic through technical documentation pages
6. "You need to write. There's no excuse...There's no other way for people to find out what you're doing."

**Tech Stack:** Chrome browser extension, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, Slack API (Sparkly), PHP
