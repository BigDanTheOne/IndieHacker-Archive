Siqi Chen, a tech entrepreneur and founder/CEO of fintech startup Runway, received an extraordinary gift from the Solana crypto community. His 4-year-old daughter Mira was diagnosed with craniopharyngioma, a rare brain tumor with limited research funding. On Christmas Eve, Chen posted to X requesting donations through a GoFundMe campaign.

The post gained significant traction with 3 million views. After Chen shared his crypto wallet addresses, one investor created a memecoin called $MIRA in Mira's honor and transferred half the supply to Chen's wallet. Initially valued at $400,000, the coin's market capitalization eventually reached $80 million, making Chen's holdings worth approximately $40 million at peak.

Demonstrating restraint, Chen chose not to immediately liquidate his holdings. Instead, he implemented a measured selling strategy: "sell $1,000 every 10 mins in perpetuity."

## Revenue Numbers

- $400,000 (initial valuation of Chen's holdings)
