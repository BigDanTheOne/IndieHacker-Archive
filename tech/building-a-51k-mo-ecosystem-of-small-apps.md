Sorin Alupoaie is a software engineer who started Swifteq in 2020 as a solo founder. The company builds applications for the Zendesk ecosystem that help support teams work more effectively. The product suite includes ticket and help center translation, an agent copilot, automation tools, and efficiency-focused applications. Currently, Swifteq generates approximately EUR 44k in monthly recurring revenue with solid overall growth trends.

**Building the right kind of career**

Alupoaie was motivated by independence rather than purely financial gains. He wanted responsibility for his own outcomes rather than being embedded in a large organization. He specifically chose to build a bootstrapped, founder-owned business after experiencing investor relationships previously.

**Researching and building the first app**

Alupoaie researched his target market extensively by reading community forums, particularly the Zendesk community site and Support Driven, where support professionals openly discuss pain points. He identified a recurring problem: agents manually merging duplicate tickets. He built "Merge Duplicated Tickets," which automatically merges duplicates based on predefined rules, shipping quickly and iterating based on user feedback.

**Navigating platform risk**

Building on Zendesk creates significant risk. When Zendesk releases overlapping native features, his revenue suffers. One app lost approximately EUR 2,000 in monthly revenue when Zendesk launched similar functionality. To mitigate this, Alupoaie diversifies through multiple apps rather than relying on a single product.

**Organic growth strategy**

Growth has relied on multiple channels:
- Communities: Staying close to where Zendesk customers congregate
- Free tools: Simple, useful free applications on the Zendesk marketplace that drive discovery of paid products
- Content and SEO: Publishing SEO-focused articles generating consistent Google traffic
- Partner relationships: Building informal relationships with Zendesk employees and independent consultants

**Five pieces of advice:**
1. Focus on distribution: marketing requires equal emphasis to product development
2. Hire earlier than expected to create mental space for strategy
3. Price high: Low prices attract uncommitted customers who churn easily
4. Don't isolate yourself: Stay connected with respected individuals
5. Protect your energy: Burnout is the only real failure mode for bootstrapped founders

**Revenue Numbers:**
- EUR 44k MRR (approximately $51k USD)
- EUR 2,000 monthly revenue lost from one app due to Zendesk competing features
- Target: one to two million ARR

**Key Lessons:**
- Deep customer research before building identifies genuine recurring pain points
- Portfolio diversification reduces platform risk better than betting on one product
- Free tools create natural upsell paths
- Appropriate pricing attracts serious customers
- Protecting mental health prevents burnout, the primary failure mode for solo founders
- Platform risk is real; standalone solutions offer more control

**Tech Stack:**
React (frontend), Node.js and MongoDB (API layer), Python with Flask (heavy processing), AWS, Zendesk marketplace
