The piece outlines the EU's new AI Act regulation and its implications for startups building AI solutions. The regulation employs a risk-based classification system with four categories.

## Risk Levels

- **Minimal risk** includes everyday applications like spam filters and recommendation systems with no compliance obligations
- **Limited risk** covers chatbots and deepfake generators requiring transparency disclosures
- **High-risk** applications (healthcare, hiring, loans, autonomous vehicles) require risk assessments, data logging, and human oversight
- **Unacceptable risk** includes banned applications like social scoring systems, emotional inference at work/school, and mass facial recognition databases

## General Purpose AI (GPAI) Requirements

Large language models like GPT-4 and Claude must provide technical documentation, comply with copyright law, and publish training data summaries. Models presenting "systemic risk" need adversarial testing and incident reporting.

## Implementation Timeline

- August 1, 2024: Act took effect
- August 2, 2025: Member states designate enforcement authorities
- August 2026: Most rules become enforceable

## Penalties

Fines reach 35 million euros or 7% of global annual revenue for prohibited practices, with lesser penalties for other violations.

## Blocked Tools

Sora, Meta AI, Veo 2, and Apple Intelligence features faced restrictions due to privacy and transparency concerns.

## Key Lessons

1. Simple AI applications face minimal regulatory burden; complexity triggers compliance requirements
2. Transparency requirements now apply to AI interactions with users
3. Compliance costs range from "1-2.7% of revenue" for small/medium businesses
4. Regulatory differences between jurisdictions create competitive disadvantages for European developers
5. Planning compliance early reduces operational friction

## Tech Stack Mentioned
