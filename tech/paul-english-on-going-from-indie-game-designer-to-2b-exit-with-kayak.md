Paul English transitioned from indie game developer to serial entrepreneur. His first venture--a video game created as a teenager--sold for $25,000, which he describes as more meaningful than his later mega-exit because it validated software as a career path.

English founded QSHOP during the dot-com era as an e-commerce platform for small businesses threatened by Amazon. Intuit acquired the company.

Co-founding Kayak as a travel search engine, English served as CTO. The company initially struggled--their Flash-based interface was problematic, and their original logo earned a "worst logo on the web" award. After hiring designer Lincoln Jackson, the product improved dramatically. Kayak expanded from flight searches to hotels, rental cars, cruises, and vacation packages. The company eventually sold for $2 billion.

English emphasizes measuring "the number of seconds it takes from when someone first sees your product to when they say 'wow.'" This should ideally occur in less than a minute. The most effective growth lever involves "having your early users brag about you to their friends, showing their excitement that they (the early users) 'discovered' you."

He contends that "how well you hire" represents the critical difference between modest and billion-dollar outcomes, dismissing arguments that all-star teams create ego clashes and noting top performers actually enjoy collaborating with other excellent people.

English now operates Boston Venture Studio with eight products in development (five active): Deets, Lola, PartyClick, Supercal, SpamStrike, Xiangqi, Reki, Middle, and Funcontact. He aims to build 1-3 companies annually, emphasizing AI-first approaches, including meeting intelligence software and therapy companion AI tools.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- First game exit: $25,000
- Kayak.com sale: $2 billion
- Additional exits in gaming, e-commerce, security, customer service, and podcasting

**Key Lessons:**
- Speed to "Wow": measure seconds from first product view to user saying "wow"--ideally under a minute
- Most effective growth: having early users brag about discovering you to their friends
- "How well you hire" is the critical difference between modest and billion-dollar outcomes
- "You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with"
- Ancillary products increase per-user revenue (e.g., adding hotels to flight search)

**Tech Stack:**
Python, Go, Django, FastAPI (backend), React, Next.js, Vue.js (web), Swift, Java, React Native (mobile), AWS, Docker, GitHub Actions (infrastructure), PostgreSQL, Segment, Amplitude (data), Cursor, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mem0, Replicate (AI development)
