Emmanuel Straschnov and cofounder Josh created Bubble, the no-code platform, growing it to 3M+ users. They turned down job offers without formal market testing, betting on democratizing software development.

## Revenue Numbers

- Monthly: Between $1.67MM and $8.33MM
- Annual: Between $20M and $100M

## Key Lessons

1. **Skip rigid validation when you have conviction:** The founders bet on democratizing software development without formal market testing.
2. **Prioritize product depth over premature launches:** "Until you have a stable product, fewer customers with more in-depth feedback is better than many customers with shallow feedback."
3. **Do unscalable things initially:** Spending an hour daily on screenshare calls with early customers provided invaluable product refinement.
4. **Community becomes competitive moat:** The Bubble Forum evolved into an ecosystem where agencies formed, creating a flywheel effect.
5. **First-mover advantage requires education:** Establishing credibility and market understanding during category creation proved more valuable than speed alone.
6. **Content and partnerships outperform paid ads:** These channels drive higher-quality traffic.
7. **Start building immediately** with minimal investment using modern tools.

**Tech Stack:** Node.js (backend), Postgres (database), avoided React/Angular, leveraged open-source projects
