The UK announced it would transfer the British Indian Ocean Territory (Chagos Islands) to Mauritius. This geopolitical shift threatens the ".io" domain, which relies on the territory's ISO 3166-1 country code designation.

The ".io" domain gained popularity among tech startups since its 1997 registration, partly due to its resemblance to "input/output." Country-specific domains depend on ISO standard abbreviations maintained by the International Organization for Standardization. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) uses these codes to establish country domains.

If "IO" is removed from the ISO list, ICANN's 5-year retirement protocol would trigger. Existing ".io" websites would need migration to new domains, and new registrations would cease. This protocol emerged after the Soviet Union's ".su" domain became associated with cybercriminals.

However, industry observers suggest "ICANN will probably license the rights to Mauritius" given the domain's commercial significance. ICANN acknowledged "multiple potential outcomes," possibly involving operational nexus requirements with Mauritius.

The timeline remains uncertain. Mauritius must first sign a treaty (after November elections), which the UK parliament must ratify next year. Only after "IO" is removed from ISO standards would the 5-year retirement period begin. The entire process could extend beyond a decade.

## Key Lessons

- Consider geopolitical stability when selecting domain names
- Domain infrastructure relies on international standards that can shift unexpectedly
- Regulatory frameworks around legacy domain management remain developing
