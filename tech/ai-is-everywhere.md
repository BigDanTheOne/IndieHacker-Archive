The article discusses preparing products for AI integration. Key sections include why product fitness for AI matters, highlighting risks like unpredictable model outputs, data dependencies, compliance concerns, and higher stakes for failures. Mitchell explains that "AI can produce surprises in real-life usage" and that poor data management poses significant challenges.

The piece outlines a strategic approach using a parallel workstream to address AI readiness while building business cases. It provides an eight-category AI readiness checklist: data readiness, infrastructure support, AI strategy alignment, team readiness, feature readiness, risk management, go-to-market readiness, and monitoring/iteration.

Post-launch monitoring requirements include maintaining data cleanliness, scaling workloads, tracking business goals, auditing governance, and gathering customer feedback. The article concludes that preparation prevents costly rework and positions companies to lead rather than follow AI trends.

**Key Lessons:**
- Proactive AI readiness prevents expensive future rework
- Cross-functional collaboration (data experts, engineering, legal) is essential
- Ongoing monitoring and governance distinguish successful AI implementations
