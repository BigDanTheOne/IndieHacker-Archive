## Full Article

Alex Tew's entrepreneurial journey spans from childhood comic sales to building a meditation empire. As a beatboxer-turned-internet-personality, Tew created the Million Dollar Homepage in 2005 -- a 1,000,000-pixel webpage sold in 100-pixel blocks at $1 per pixel. The project generated $1M in revenue within 138 days.

Following early success, Tew's post-fame period (2006-2010) involved failed imitations like Pixelotto and OneMillionPeople. A breakthrough came with "Sock and Awe," a viral shoe-throwing flash game capitalizing on George W. Bush's 2008 shoe incident, which attracted 9 million visitors in one week.

Struggling with stress and mental health challenges, Tew discovered meditation and launched DoNothingFor2Minutes.com in January 2011 -- a simple site featuring sunset visuals, wave sounds, and a two-minute timer. This generated 2 million visits in ten days and presaged his larger venture.

Calm, co-founded in 2012 with $1.5M initial funding, evolved from a website into a mobile app. The platform reached $2 billion valuation through consistent user acquisition. In 2014, Tew created Checky, a phone-addiction tracking app generating 650,000 downloads monthly and funneling 50,000 users to Calm.

## Key Lessons (MVP Framework)

1. Capitalize on trending moments and zeitgeist events
2. Develop creative, absurd concepts answering audacious questions
3. Build secondary viral products directing traffic to primary offerings
4. "Don't spend more than two days building it"
5. Leverage social media, journalist outreach, influencer partnerships
6. Redirect traffic toward main products or collect email lists

Critical Quote: Tew reflected that "success can actually be bad, and can teach you the wrong things. I was thinking about ideas that would get attention instead of provide value."
