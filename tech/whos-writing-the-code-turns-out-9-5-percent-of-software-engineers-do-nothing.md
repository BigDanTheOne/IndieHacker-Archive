A Stanford study analyzed data from over 50,000 engineers across hundreds of companies using private Git repositories. Researchers simulated expert panels to evaluate productivity across multiple dimensions of code commits and contributions.

The findings revealed that approximately 9.5% of software engineers -- termed "Ghost Engineers" -- contribute minimally to their teams while receiving compensation. The percentage varies significantly by work location: 14% of remote workers fall into this category, compared to 9% of hybrid workers and 6% of office-based employees. Interestingly, the highest-performing engineers (producing 5X outputs) predominantly work remotely.

Over half of all engineers make fewer than three commits monthly, with many involving minimal single-line edits. The financial impact is substantial: analysts estimated potential annual savings of $465 billion for twelve major companies if these underperforming engineers were removed. Global estimates suggest annual waste of approximately $90 billion even at conservative 6.5% rates.

**Revenue/Financial Numbers Mentioned:**
- $465 billion annually (estimated savings for 12 top companies)
- $90 billion annually (global waste estimate at 6.5% rate)
- $200,000-$300,000 (annual compensation referenced)

**Key Lessons:**
1. Remote work enables both exceptional productivity and underperformance
2. Git metrics alone inadequately measure engineering value
3. Invisible work (mentoring, architecture decisions, prevented failures) lacks visibility in traditional metrics
4. Management clarity and task allocation significantly impact productivity
5. Knowledge work autonomy creates both opportunity and accountability challenges
