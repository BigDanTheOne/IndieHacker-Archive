The article discusses how AI is enabling a new business playbook: separating intelligence from service delivery across the $25 trillion services sector. The author compares this transformation to previous decades' shifts—Apple and Nvidia separating IP from manufacturing in the 2000s, and Salesforce enabling cloud-based software utilities in the 2010s.

The piece outlines three distinct models:

1. **Model Rollups:** Companies build proprietary AI models while delivering services 5-7x cheaper and faster than incumbents, then acquire smaller agencies to accumulate data and fuel continuous improvement. One anonymous company scaled this approach to $10M+ revenue.

2. **Growth Buyouts:** Metropolis exemplifies this model—starting as parking industry SaaS, they acquired Premier Parking (600 locations) and negotiated a ~$1.5B deal with SP+ to scale their vision and software IP, reducing labor costs through unmanned facilities and intelligent billing.

3. **Vertical Rollup:** A fictional senior living company uses a hybrid PE-VC structure, acquiring facilities and applying voice models for patient intake and text models for care coordination, improving margins by 15-20%.

**Revenue Numbers Mentioned:**
- $25 trillion services sector
- $10 million+ (anonymous Company A)
- ~$1.5 billion (Metropolis/SP+ deal)
- $57 billion title insurance market
- $399 billion insurance TPAs market
- $656 billion enterprise software market

**Key Lessons:**
- "The separation of intelligence from service delivery" creates operating leverage beyond traditional consolidation
- Data flywheels strengthen with acquisitions, progressively improving margins
- GitHub Copilot increases developer productivity by 29%; Harvey's law firm copilot boosted utilization from 33% to 69%
- Disruption from outside (like Lemonade's insurance approach) struggles against established players; inside-out acquisition strategies prove more effective
- Financial structure and deal mechanics matter as much as technology itself

**Tech Stack Mentioned:**
- Proprietary AI models (SOTA—state-of-the-art)
- Voice-to-voice models
- Text models
- Vision models (license plate recognition)
- Copilots (GitHub Copilot, Harvey)
- Vertical SaaS platforms
