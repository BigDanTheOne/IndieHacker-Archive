Braden Dennis, an engineer previously working in nuclear and hydropower, became obsessed with investing and entrepreneurship. He identified a critical gap in financial data tools—expensive, exclusive terminals on one end versus free, clunky, ad-filled platforms on the other. He built Fiscal.ai, the first AI-native financial data company, to solve this "missing middle" problem.

The platform aggregates freely available financial statements from public companies and delivers them through a clean, professional interface. The backend uses multiple LLMs, Python, and Cloudflare, while the frontend leverages React and Next.js.

Dennis emphasizes that "building data (DaaS) products takes a lot longer than software" solutions, yet the team launched without waiting for perfection. The company now serves hundreds of thousands of users and partners with over fifty enterprises integrating their data into products.

The growth strategy combines product-led growth for self-serve users with direct sales for B2B enterprise customers. Dennis notes they've "never wasted any money on ads yet," focusing instead on product quality and word-of-mouth expansion.

Inspiration comes from Toyota's Kaizen framework—continuous improvement in small increments. Rather than pursuing major pivots, the team experiments systematically while staying grounded in customer feedback and core problems.

On fundraising and future direction, Dennis remains uncertain about personal next steps but emphasizes focusing first on acquiring customers willing to pay for solutions. His advice: "Just start" and trust intuition while making decisions with incomplete information.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Mid-seven-figure ARR (over $400K monthly)
- Expected to hit eight figures within six months
- Plans to double again after reaching eight figures

**Key Lessons:**
- Identify genuine market gaps between premium and free solutions
- Ship imperfect products early and iterate continuously
- Embrace continuous improvement philosophy (Kaizen)
- Combine product-led growth and direct sales strategically
- Trust your intuition as a founder making decisions with incomplete information
- Data products require patience—they take substantially longer to build than traditional SaaS

**Tech Stack:**
React, Next.js, Python, multiple LLMs, Cloudflare
