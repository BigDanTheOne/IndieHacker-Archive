## Company: Mockey.ai
## Founders: Pranay Agarwal and Mofid Ansari

## Revenue Numbers

## Key Lessons

1. **Solve Real Problems:** The founders identified a genuine gap -- existing mockup tools were slow and required specialized software knowledge.
2. **Start Small & Validate:** Beginning with only t-shirt mockups allowed rapid validation before expanding the product line.
3. **Build During Off-Hours:** The product was developed nights-and-weekends during full-time employment, minimizing financial risk.
4. **Prioritize User Experience:** Minimal cognitive load and instant preview functionality drove adoption.
5. **Strategic Monetization:** Implementing download limits increased revenue 3x, proving that friction motivates conversions.
6. **SEO + Community Focus:** The team leveraged organic search and design communities (particularly a Figma community file) as distribution channels, while avoiding algorithm penalties from off-topic content.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Vue.js
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Deployment:** Browser-based application

## Business Model

Hybrid approach combining freemium subscriptions with display advertising. Free tier allows three mockups daily; paid tiers unlock unlimited generation.
