Bluesky has reached 23 million users and is already sending more referral traffic than X and Threads for certain publishers. Dave Earley from Guardian Australia reported their Bluesky posts generated more traffic to theguardian.com in the first week than any week on X this year -- at least twice the visits from Threads. Matt Karolian from The Boston Globe noted three times more traffic from Bluesky than Threads, with four and a half times more conversions to digital subscribers.

Bluesky functions similarly to Twitter with 256-character posts, media support, and standard interactions. It operates on the open-source AT Protocol and offers customizable feeds. Critically, the platform does not penalize posts containing external links. Bluesky's COO Rose Wang stated: "We want Bluesky to be a great home for journalists, publishers, and creators. Unlike other platforms, we don't de-promote your links."

Independent publishers report significant shifts. Luke Plunkett from Aftermath saw their Twitter-to-Bluesky referral ratio change from 9:1 to under 2:1 within three months. Alejandro Tauber from EUobserver reported Bluesky (3.3K followers) generated 3.8K unique visitors versus X's 1.32K from 203K followers in one week.

Elon Musk confirmed X decreases visibility for posts with links, recommending users "write a description in the main post and put the link in the reply."

Bluesky's growth strategy mirrors TikTok's early approach -- democratizing visibility for all users, potentially creating opportunity for indie hackers building products or growing audiences.

**Key Lessons:**
- Platforms that don't penalize external links create advantages for content creators and publishers
- Early adoption on emerging platforms can yield disproportionate traffic gains
- Algorithmic transparency and customizable feeds attract creators frustrated with other platforms
- Distribution strategy significantly impacts content reach and audience conversion
