Ghost has reached $7M Annual Recurring Revenue, representing approximately 9x increase since ~$750,000/year in 2017.

Founder John O'Nolan emphasizes that Ghost's success came through "steady iteration and improvement on what we do, over a long period of time" rather than rapid scaling tactics. The platform grew without external funding, growth hacks, or traditional sales approaches -- demonstrating that sustainable business building prioritizes product excellence and customer value over venture-backed acceleration.
