Google released Gemini 2.5, with early benchmarks indicating superior coding performance compared to Claude 3.7 Sonnet. However, limited developer adoption persists due to two primary barriers: a $20/month subscription cost and minimal integration with Cursor, the dominant AI code editor.

The article notes that OpenAI's new image generation capabilities have overshadowed Google's release in media coverage. Initial Cursor support was unavailable, forcing workarounds. Even after official integration launched, aggressive rate limiting restricted daily usage to minimal code generations.

Google AI Studio provides temporary free access but lacks essential features: token management requires deleting previous conversations, no project organization exists, and Project Rules (custom per-project settings) are absent. The author describes manually copying code between platforms for workflow continuity.

Developer sentiment suggests success depends on partnership expansion. One developer states: "Gemini 2.5 Pro is now *easily* the best model for code" and highlights its 1M token context window and ability to complete tickets independently.

Comments reveal mixed experiences: some users report hallucinations and regression issues during iterative development, while others praise one-shot capabilities. Alternative solutions like OpenRouter are mentioned as workarounds.

## Key Lessons

- Technical superiority alone doesn't guarantee market adoption
- Integration ecosystem matters significantly for developer tools
- Pricing and accessibility barriers can undermine competitive advantages
