Google I/O 2025 featured a broad set of AI-related announcements, positioning AI as core infrastructure across products rather than isolated features.

Gemini 2.5 received updates including a Deep Think feature providing extended reasoning capabilities, topping LiveCodeBench for coding and achieving strong USAMO math scores. Thought Summaries organize AI reasoning into structured formats for developer debugging. These features are available to AI Ultra subscribers after safety checks complete.

On the media generation front, Veo 3 adds audio generation to video creation, enabling sound effects and dialogue alongside visual content. Imagen 4 improves detail rendering in images, including fabric textures and typography. Flow combines multiple models to simplify cinematic video production from text descriptions.

Hardware announcements included the Android XR platform for smart glasses featuring Gemini integration with AR overlays and notifications, with partnerships announced with Gentle Monster, Warby Parker, and Xreal. Workspace integration across Gmail, Docs, and Slides now features Gemini capabilities.

Additional tools include SynthID Detector for identifying AI-generated content through watermark verification and an enhanced Chrome browsing assistant with Gemini integration.
