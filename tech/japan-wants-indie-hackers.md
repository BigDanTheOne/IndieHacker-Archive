Japan is launching a Digital Nomad Visa offering six-month stays for remote workers exploring its startup ecosystem. The nation ranks 10th globally in startup rankings -- five positions higher than the previous year -- with $6.4 billion in government investment planned over five years.

The article outlines four key opportunities for indie hackers:

1. **Community engagement**: Tokyo hosts foreigner-friendly startup events including Venture Cafe Tokyo weekly meetups and SushiTech Tokyo conferences, primarily conducted in English.

2. **Expertise sharing**: Global talent in SaaS, AI, and marketing is in demand among Japanese startups seeking to expand into Western markets.

3. **Corporate consulting**: Legacy Japanese corporations lack agility and seek guidance from indie hackers on innovation and startup collaboration.

4. **Long-term pathway**: The Digital Nomad Visa serves as a trial before pursuing Japan's Startup Visa for permanent business establishment.

**Revenue Numbers Mentioned:**
- $6.4 billion in startup funding over next 5 years

**Key Lessons:**
- Remote business owners can network and test ideas without local work restrictions
- Japan offers "the perfect mix of flexibility and inspiration" for indie builders
- Younger generations increasingly embrace entrepreneurship, creating talent pools
