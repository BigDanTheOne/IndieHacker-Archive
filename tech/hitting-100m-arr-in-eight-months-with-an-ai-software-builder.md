Anton Osika studied physics at university and worked at CERN before becoming an engineer at Swedish tech companies Sana and Depict. He identified a critical barrier: "99% of people have great ideas and can execute on a business, but they don't know how to write code." He created GPT-Engineer as a weekend proof-of-concept, receiving immediate community enthusiasm.

GPT-Engineer evolved into Lovable, an AI software builder transforming ideas into functional software within minutes. The platform serves non-technical users, experienced developers, and enterprise teams. Lovable launched in late 2024 and reached 2M users with $100M ARR within eight months.

**Growth Metrics:**
- 2.3M active users across 190+ countries
- 10M+ total projects created
- 100,000+ new projects daily
- $8.3M monthly revenue

**Major Incident:**
One month post-launch, GitHub suspended their app without warning, taking down the platform for 500,000 users due to suspicious rapid repository creation patterns. After escalation to GitHub's CEO, they recovered all data.

**Growth Drivers:**
- Community focus: 6-week "Shipped" cohort engaged 6,000+ participants
- Free Weekend Promotion: attracted 134,000 simultaneous project builders
- Market timing: Rapid AI capability advancement created the perfect launch window

**Pricing Strategy:**
They adopted "make it easy to try, obvious to buy" philosophy. When moving Team plan users to cheaper Pro plans, they sacrificed $1.5M ARR in one day to simplify messaging and boost activation. "Pricing is product—optimize for adoption and clarity."

The ~40-person team is based in Stockholm. Osika aims for Lovable to become "the most important company that has ever been created in Europe."

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $100M ARR in 8 months
- $8.3M monthly revenue
- $1.5M ARR sacrificed for pricing simplification

**Key Lessons:**
- Removing the coding requirement unlocked massive demand among non-technical builders
- Community precedes revenue: Word-of-mouth outperformed traditional acquisition
- Pricing simplification beats revenue optimization: Strategic short-term loss improves long-term activation
- Team quality over size: 40 exceptional people achieved outsized impact
- Geographic independence works: European talent access proved superior

**Tech Stack:**
GPT-Engineer (initial CLI), Lovable AI software builder platform, GitHub integration
