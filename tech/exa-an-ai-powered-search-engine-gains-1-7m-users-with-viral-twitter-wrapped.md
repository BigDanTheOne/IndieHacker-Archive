The piece chronicles how Exa, an AI startup providing web data to applications, launched a personalized Twitter recap tool on December 26th that achieved extraordinary viral success. Within four days, the campaign garnered 59,000 reposts and 13.6 million views, converting to 1.7 million users -- representing one of the most impactful side project marketing campaigns ever executed.

The article explains the virality through comparison to Spotify Wrapped, which drives 20% increases in downloads despite serving over 626 million active users. Twitter had lacked an official "wrapped" feature, creating an opportunity Exa seized. High-profile endorsements from figures like Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian and Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan amplified reach.

## Key Lessons

- Side project marketing drives significant user acquisition when inherently shareable
