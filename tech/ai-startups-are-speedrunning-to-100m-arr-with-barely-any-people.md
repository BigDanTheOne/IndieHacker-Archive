The piece contrasts traditional startup scaling with modern AI-driven growth. Slack took 2.5 years and 385 employees to reach $100M ARR, but the landscape has transformed dramatically.

## Case Studies

- Midjourney: $50M ARR in 1 year, 11 employees
- Mercor: $50M ARR in 2 years, 30 employees
- Cal AI: $21M ARR in 10 months, 2 employees
- bolt.new: $20M ARR in 2 months, 15 employees
- Lovable: $10M ARR in 2 months, 15 employees

The article argues that "soon we will see a solo founder, armed with AI agents, with a billion-dollar company."

## Key Lessons

1. **Team size is no longer a limiting factor** -- AI handles work previously requiring dozens of employees
2. **Speed of execution has accelerated exponentially** -- Multi-year scaling timelines have compressed to months
3. **Capital efficiency improved** -- Large seed rounds are becoming optional for achieving significant ARR
4. **The startup playbook has fundamentally changed** -- Traditional hiring and growth strategies are now obsolete
