Iron Brands abandoned a brief finance career to pursue indie hacking. After graduating with a finance degree, he completed an internship at a financial consultancy but quickly realized corporate work wasn't his path.

He co-founded Fiks, a marketplace for internships, with university classmates, scaling it to 100K ARR before stepping away. Recognizing his passion for building, he relocated to Amsterdam to network with other founders. At a developer meetup, he met Adriaan van Rossum, who had founded Simple Analytics years earlier as a solo operation.

The two partnered to expand Simple Analytics from 10K MRR to its current 45K MRR. The company maintains transparency through an open metrics dashboard.

Beyond Simple Analytics, Brands co-founded UniHosted, a managed-hosting service for UniFi Controllers, with Adriaan and Dries approximately two years ago. He describes the venture as generating "substantial" revenue, though less than Simple Analytics.

Most recently, the team acquired Leadsontrees.com, which alerts users about funding announcements. Initially operating on lifetime deals, they transitioned to monthly pricing and currently generate approximately 250 MRR from this acquisition.

**Growth Strategy Phases:**
Initially, founders must execute non-scalable tactics: engaging on Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook groups; directly helping potential users; gathering feedback; and iterating rapidly.

Once establishing product-market fit, the focus shifts to sustainable, repeatable channels. For Simple Analytics, this became SEO through answering niche-specific questions, creating "Alternative to" comparison pages, building backlinks, implementing programmatic SEO, and maintaining quality standards.

**Reverse Free Trial Strategy:**
Simple Analytics offers a distinctive "reverse free trial" where new users access the complete product with all features for 14 days, regardless of subscription tier. After this period, users select their preferred plan based on usage recommendations.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Fiks: 100K ARR (at exit)
- Simple Analytics: 10K MRR (pre-partnership) to 45K MRR (current)
- UniHosted: "Substantial" revenue
- Leadsontrees: 250 MRR

**Key Lessons:**
- "Going from zero to one is a hustle...do things that don't scale"
- Start early before financial obligations restrict risk-taking
- Transition from non-scalable tactics to repeatable channels once PMF exists
- Complementary co-founder skills accelerate scaling
- Learn from failures rather than abandoning entrepreneurship

**Tech Stack:**
Vue (frontend), Node (backend), Semrush, Seogets, Substack, Mailgun, Firecrawl, Loom
