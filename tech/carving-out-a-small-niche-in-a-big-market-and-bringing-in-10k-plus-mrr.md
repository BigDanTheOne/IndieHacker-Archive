Elie Steinbock founded Inbox Zero, an AI executive assistant for email management. He created the product to solve his own problem: spending excessive time on email while running a previous business. Rather than hire a human assistant (costing thousands monthly), he wondered if AI could handle email management instead.

The product organizes emails, drafts replies, and helps users achieve "Inbox Zero" status quickly. Development took several months, beginning when AI models were less capable than today.

Steinbock initially tested multiple features to identify what resonated, but learned that focus outperforms breadth. He emphasized that "users only have so much attention, so if you try and tell them we do ten things, it's too much." Successful products excel at one specific task rather than attempting comprehensive solutions.

Growth channels included:
- Open source distribution (achieved #1 GitHub trending status)
- ProductHunt ranking (#1 placement)
- Early lifetime deals (closed after generating initial revenue)
- SEO dominance ("Inbox Zero" Google ranking)
- Referral mechanics

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Over $10,000 MRR

**Key Lessons:**
- "Do one thing really, really well" rather than spreading across multiple features
- Simpler, focused products often outcompete more powerful but complex alternatives
- Open source serves as a legitimate growth and distribution channel
- Solving your own pain point validates market demand
- Feature discipline matters more than feature quantity
- Strong copy, landing pages, and discoverability matter alongside product excellence

**Tech Stack:**
Next.js, TypeScript, React, Prisma, Neon, Vercel, PostHog, Sentry, Axiom, Upstash (Redis/queues), Shadcn, Tailwind CSS
