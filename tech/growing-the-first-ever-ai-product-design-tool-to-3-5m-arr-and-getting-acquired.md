## Revenue Numbers

- $292K monthly revenue ($3.5M ARR at acquisition)
- Multiple months in 2023 added $1M revenue in single months
- 100k-240k new users signing up monthly during 2023-2024

## Key Lessons

1. **Distribution matters most.** Tony emphasizes focusing "on distribution from day one" rather than assuming "build it and they will come" works.
2. **Price early for validation.** Waiting too long to introduce pricing delayed product-market fit validation.
3. **Build trust in AI.** Educating users about AI capabilities and limitations was critical, especially in 2021 pre-ChatGPT.
4. **Pair product with strategy.** "True success came when we paired a strong product with effective distribution strategies, including content marketing and viral loops."
5. **Product-led growth scales.** Self-serve accounted for 98% of revenue; enterprise sales only 2%.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend/Backend: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js
- AI/ML: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
- LLMs: OpenAI GPT models, Anthropic Claude
- Infrastructure: AWS, cloud-based GPUs
- Unique approach: Entire infinite canvas built with HTML DOM (not WebGL or canvas)

## Growth Levers

- Word of mouth (95% of users)
- Open-source virality (pix2code GitHub project)
- SEO targeting AI/design keywords
- Viral video demos
- Gamified waitlists (100k signups for 1.0 launch)
- Strategic timing during ChatGPT/AI hype wave
