## Full Article

Yu-An Chan built Heptabase, a visual note-taking tool for learning complex topics. His journey included dropping out of two universities and going through Y Combinator. Key phases included initial false starts with an overly ambitious product, a pivot to a focused MVP centered on reusable atomic knowledge cards, and growth through Discord community engagement and word-of-mouth.

## Key Lessons

1. **Problem-First Approach:** "Taking notes visually" isn't the problem; "learning complex topics" is what matters.
2. **Launch Quickly:** Avoid perfectionism. Chan states, "launch quickly and talk to users to get deeper understanding."
3. **User Research:** Conducted one-on-one interviews with screen-sharing before allowing product access.
4. **Early Monetization:** Implemented paywall at ~100 users to identify committed customers and accelerate product-market fit.
5. **Organic Growth Strategy:** Focused on community building, word-of-mouth marketing, and affiliate partnerships rather than paid acquisition.
6. **Continuous Iteration:** "Keep talking to users and refine your vision accordingly."
