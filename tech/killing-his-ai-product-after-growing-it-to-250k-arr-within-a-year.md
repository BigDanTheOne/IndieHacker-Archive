## Full Article

Ulric Musset and cofounder Cyril Pluche launched Marblism following their successful exit from fintech startup Vauban to Carta. The new venture offered AI-powered business employees including an executive assistant, social media manager, blog writer, and sales assistant.

The product initially launched in January 2024 as an AI engineer capable of building full-stack applications. Despite reaching $250K ARR within twelve months and 100,000 users, the founders discovered a critical mismatch: their target audience wasn't developers but non-technical business owners.

**The Pivot:** Users struggled with implementation despite the product's sophistication. Rather than optimize the existing approach, the team completely restructured the offering into specialized AI employee roles, relaunching one week prior to this article's publication.

## Key Lessons

1. **Audience misalignment matters more than growth metrics** — rapid user acquisition masked fundamental product-market fit issues
2. **User education prevents pivots** — investing in onboarding earlier could have prevented extensive restructuring
3. **Reverse-prompting improves adoption** — having AI proactively request user approval rather than assuming perfect prompting skills
4. **Timing beats execution** — launching during AI's peak hype provided natural momentum, but sustainability requires different focus
5. **Avoid vision attachment** — "Don't marry your initial vision" when user behavior contradicts assumptions
6. **Pricing simplicity wins** — switching from per-employee charging to bundled packages improved clarity

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Infrastructure:** AWS
- **AI Models:** Customized, fine-tuned LLMs for specific tasks (email handling, agentic behaviors, content creation)
- **Token optimization:** Systems designed to use fewer tokens while maintaining quality

## Future Direction

Target: $1 million ARR by year-end through expanded AI employee roster and multi-agent collaborative systems where specialized agents communicate and delegate tasks internally.
