Eric Provencher built Repo Prompt while on parental leave, initially to solve his own workflow frustration with Claude Opus 3's 200k token context window. The macOS native app helps developers manage context for AI models and apply edits efficiently through an XML format compatible with ChatGPT, Claude, and other platforms.

Provencher started with roughly $5k from a donations page, then transitioned to a paid model (lifetime and monthly options) on March 9, 2024. He achieved over $10k/month MRR within a year and recently left full-time employment to focus exclusively on the product.

Initial traction came through Reddit posts in AI communities and cold outreach to AI content creators. A breakthrough came with McKay Wrigley's tutorial video. An active Discord community of power users became central to growth. Provencher emphasizes: "Focus on building community around your product, first and foremost."

When launching paid features, Provencher faced backlash from free users. He responded by doubling the free tier limits and adding a monthly billing option, which stabilized the community response and enabled sustainable growth. He notes: "No one wants to pay money for things they like to use, but at the same time, people don't always value things that are free."

Provencher plans to integrate Repo Prompt with coding agents via Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance and steer AI agent capabilities.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- ~$5k initially from donations page
