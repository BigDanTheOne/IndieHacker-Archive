Yasha Boroumand began programming in middle school and experimented with transformer models in high school. His early ventures included urlslab.com, a website monitoring scraper that ultimately failed due to scaling difficulties, followed by a WordPress SEO plugin rebrand that also didn't succeed.

Currently, Boroumand operates FlowHunt.io, described as "one of the first AI-agent builders" enabling users to create chatbots and complex AI workflows for SEO, back-office tasks, and sales applications. The platform generates $10k/mo -- $6k from subscriptions and $4k from one-off credits.

**Development Journey:**
FlowHunt's prototype was built within two months, with marketing commencing July 2024. The first customer arrived during the initial marketing month, with an enterprise customer acquired six months later.

**Revenue Model:**
FlowHunt employs a hybrid pricing structure combining tier-based subscriptions with credit-based AI tokens. Higher-tier plans offer additional credit purchases.

**Growth Strategy - Dogfooding:**
The most significant growth driver involved using FlowHunt on the company's own operations. The founder automated SEO processes, generating more than 2k pages ranking on 6k+ keywords with 40k+ organic traffic using a single copywriter. This demonstration of capability directly translated to customer acquisition.

**Customer Support Philosophy:**
Boroumand stresses that "Customer support and customer care are the most important aspects of any startup at any stage." He maintains direct customer communication, identifying UX friction points. "No startup can succeed if the founder doesn't communicate directly with the customer."

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $10k/month current MRR
- $6k from subscriptions
- $4k from one-off credits
- 40k+ organic traffic
- 6k+ keywords ranking
- 2,000+ pages generated

**Key Lessons:**
- Persistence through failure: Two failed products provided essential learning before product-market fit
- Self-dogfooding validates products: Using FlowHunt internally demonstrated genuine capability to prospects
- Direct founder involvement essential for customer support
- Speed outweighs perfection: "Just deploy fast"
- Constant learning imperative in AI space
- SEO as sustainable growth through organic content

**Tech Stack:**
Python, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, Next.js, multiple AI models (RAG, Agentic RAG, AI Agents)
