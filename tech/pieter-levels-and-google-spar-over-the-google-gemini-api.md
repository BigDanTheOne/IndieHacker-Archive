Indie hacking legend Pieter Levels praised xAI's newly launched API for its ease of setup, claiming he configured it in "literally 30 seconds." In contrast, he expressed frustration with Google's Gemini API, stating he "gave up altogether after 30 minutes."

This prompted Zachary Nado, a DeepMind research engineer, to respond dismissively before deleting his posts. Levels countered with a video demonstrating the setup challenges weren't a user error problem. Nado eventually acknowledged getting "trigger happy" but maintained his original stance.

Logan Kilpatrick, Google's AI Studio product lead, defended their API, claiming setup requires "just three clicks." When tested, Levels found AI Studio improved but still lacked OpenAI-compatible queries and featured excessive legal disclaimers. He concluded that "Google is taken over by lawyers."

Kilpatrick responded constructively by committing to removing popups and implementing OpenAI compatibility — demonstrating a collaborative approach to addressing legitimate feedback.

**Key Lessons:**
- Developer experience significantly impacts API adoption
- Excessive compliance requirements can hinder usability
- Responsive product leadership builds trust better than dismissiveness
- Bureaucratic friction frustrates experienced developers
