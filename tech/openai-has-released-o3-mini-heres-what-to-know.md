OpenAI launched o3-mini, a compact reasoning model optimized for STEM, logic, and coding tasks. The model is accessible via ChatGPT at no cost and matches o1-mini's API pricing. According to OpenAI's benchmarking, o3-mini surpasses the full o1 model on mathematical, scientific, and programming assessments.

The release follows DeepSeek's R1 model announcement. Both platforms offer free ChatGPT access and internet search capabilities. CEO Sam Altman indicated the complete o3 model would arrive within months, emphasizing that "scientific discovery acceleration represents AGI's most significant societal benefit."

o3-mini features enhanced developer capabilities including function calling, structured outputs, and streaming support. Users can adjust computational effort -- low, medium, or high settings -- to balance speed versus accuracy. The high-effort variant demonstrates superior performance on technical benchmarks but requires longer processing times.

Pricing matches o1-mini: $1.10 per million input tokens, $0.55 cached, and $4.40 per million output tokens. ChatGPT Plus and Teams subscribers receive 150 daily messages; Pro users get unlimited access. API access rolls out to Tier 3+ accounts ($100+ spending).
