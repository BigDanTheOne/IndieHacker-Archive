Stripe is developing its first stablecoin product, leveraging technology from its $1.1 billion acquisition of Bridge, a stablecoin infrastructure provider. CEO Patrick Collison framed the initiative as a decade-long ambition finally materializing.

Collison described stablecoins as "room-temperature superconductors for financial services," suggesting they enable transformative efficiency in money movement comparable to hypothetical physics breakthroughs in electricity transmission.

Stripe reintroduced cryptocurrency payments in 2024, accepting stablecoins like USDC and Pax Dollar across Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon networks.

The article highlights several founder opportunities: integrating stablecoin payment options at checkout, building cross-border SaaS tools and marketplaces addressing slow transfers and FX costs, and developing programmable money systems enabling instant payouts, escrow, subscriptions, and tipping mechanisms.

The move signals mainstream normalization of cryptocurrency for business transactions as banks and fintech companies pursue stablecoin adoption.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Bridge acquisition: $1.1 billion

**Key Lessons:**
- Stablecoins as "room-temperature superconductors for financial services" enable transformative efficiency
