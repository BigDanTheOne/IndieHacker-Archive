Meta is developing a standalone AI application to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT, according to CNBC reporting. The company has experimented with large language models like LLaMA since 2023 and operates meta.ai as a chatbot website, but plans to launch a mobile app in Q2 2025.

Expected features include advanced AI-powered image generation, photo and video editing tools, potential integration with Meta's social platforms, and voice-based interactions. Meta intends to test a paid subscription service comparable to ChatGPT Premium and Copilot Pro.

Sam Altman responded with a tweet: "lol if facebook tries to come at us and we just uno reverse them it would be so funny"

Meta possesses significant competitive advantages, including a massive user base: 3.35 billion daily active users across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger; Facebook has 3 billion monthly active users; Instagram and WhatsApp each have approximately 2 billion monthly active users; and Facebook Messenger has around 1 billion monthly active users. These figures provide Meta with extensive training data and a built-in audience for app testing.

## Key Lessons

- Scale and existing user networks provide substantial competitive advantages in AI product launches
- Integration with established platforms can accelerate adoption
