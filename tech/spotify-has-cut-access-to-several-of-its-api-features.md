Spotify has deprecated eight API endpoints, including Related Artists, Featured Playlists, and Recommendations. The announcement was made via Spotify's developer blog. Developers expressed frustration on social media, with one noting difficulty obtaining rate limit increases before the changes took effect.

**Key Lessons:**
- Third-party applications relying on deprecated endpoints will experience broken functionality
- Developers should review Spotify's updated documentation for alternative endpoints
- Migration options include using the "/search" and "/Browse" endpoints or implementing caching solutions combined with supplementary APIs

**Tech Stack Mentioned:**
- Spotify Web API
- Related APIs: Search and Browse endpoints
