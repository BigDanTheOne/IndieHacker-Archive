ChatGPT's search function, launched in late October, regularly provides inaccurate source attributions when identifying news articles. Researchers from Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism tested the chatbot by asking it to identify 200 articles using unique quotes.

The results were concerning: ChatGPT correctly attributed only 47 articles (23.5%), partially correctly attributed 58 (29%), and completely misattributed 95 (47.5%). The chatbot frequently mixed up titles, dates, publishers, and URLs while expressing confidence in 193 of its responses.

A notable finding: blocking OpenAI's crawlers didn't prevent publications from appearing in results, nor did enabling them guarantee accurate representation. The New York Times, engaged in a copyright dispute with OpenAI, sometimes appeared as the source of quotes from other publications.

The study notes that "more rigorous experimentation is needed to understand the true frequency of errors," as it hasn't been peer-reviewed. OpenAI responded that they support "250m weekly ChatGPT users discover quality content through summaries, quotes, clear links, and attribution."

**Key Lessons:**
- AI systems can generate plausible-sounding but false information with unwarranted confidence
- Transparency about uncertainty would improve publisher relationships
- Web crawler access restrictions don't reliably control what information appears in search results
