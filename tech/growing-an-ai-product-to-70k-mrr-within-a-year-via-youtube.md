## Key Lessons

1. **Partnership Over Solo Work**: "Partner up with people as talented as you, just in a different scope of work"
2. **MVP Validation**: Launch imperfect versions quickly and iterate based on feedback
3. **YouTube-First Growth Strategy**: Three-tiered content approach -- evergreen tutorials, clickbait with high conversion, news-based trending videos
4. **Resilience Through Adversity**: Multiple setbacks (developer loss, cease-and-desist, site downtime) require bouncing back systematically
5. **Content Creation Consistency**: Post 100+ videos before expecting meaningful traction
6. **Accountability Structure**: Hire external commitments (personal trainer at 7am) to maintain discipline as a solo entrepreneur
