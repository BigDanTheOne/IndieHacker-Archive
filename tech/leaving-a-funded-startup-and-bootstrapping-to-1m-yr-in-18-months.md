Gil Hildebrand, founder of Subscribr, shares his journey from running a VC-backed crypto startup to building a bootstrapped AI tool for YouTube creators that reached $1M annual revenue in 18 months.

After 25 years coding professionally, Hildebrand became CTO at Seth Godin's Squidoo, scaling it to $10M revenue with a lean three-person engineering team over nine years.

Frustrated with the "hamster wheel" of investor relations at his crypto startup, Hildebrand decided bootstrapping offered better economics: "a solopreneur with a $1M/year business is actually far richer than a CEO of a $50M/year VC-backed business."

**Market Selection:** Following Marc Andreessen's principle that markets determine outcomes, Hildebrand sought a "Goldilocks" market. He identified YouTube's creator economy, discovering scriptwriting was a persistent pain point despite three million YouTube Partner Program channels.

**Validation Strategy:** He built mockups, collected 1,000 email subscribers through X engagement, then offered 50 lifetime subscriptions with tiered pricing. All presales sold within days, generating over $20,000 before the product existed.

Subscribr launched publicly in April 2024. Hildebrand achieved $10,000 MRR within 100 days, scaling to approximately $62,000+ monthly revenue by the article date.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Presale revenue: $20,000+ (50 lifetime deals)
- 100-day milestone: $10,000 MRR
- Current: ~$62,000+/month
- Year-to-date: Over $500,000
- Revenue increased 50% first month after cofounder joined

**Key Lessons:**
- "Think REALLY hard about the market you are entering"
- "Real validation is paying customers and money in the bank"
- De-risk through presales, side projects while employed, proven acquisition before hiring
- Profitability and ownership trump headline revenue at VC-backed companies
- Flow state and intrinsic motivation matter more than structured OKRs for solopreneurs

**Tech Stack:**
Laravel (PHP), Livewire (real-time), Horizon (job queue), DigitalOcean (single droplet), React planned for v3
