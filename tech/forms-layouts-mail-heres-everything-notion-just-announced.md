Notion has evolved from a simple note-taking app launched in 2016 into a comprehensive productivity platform. At its inaugural Make With Notion conference, the company unveiled its most significant product announcements to date.

## Forms and Layouts

The platform introduced two new building blocks. Forms enable users to "build forms and collect data within their Notion docs, removing the need for third-party extensions." Users can access, analyze, filter, and sort collected information through existing database features.

Layouts provide greater customization of page appearance. Rather than stacking blocks vertically, users can arrange them horizontally to better suit their content presentation needs.

## Marketplace and AI Updates

The Notion Marketplace is receiving native payments, safeguards, and analytics tools for template creators. Customers gain access to reviews, ratings, and improved refund processes. The company is integrating its AI assistant with external tools like Slack and Google Drive, plus developing a database search function.

## Notion Mail

The company's largest announcement concerns an email service launching in early 2025, following its February acquisition of Skiff, a secure email platform.

The AI-powered Mail app addresses inbox management through organizational prompts and intelligent categorization. A "Views" feature consolidates emails by theme. Additional capabilities include key date highlighting, message summarization on hover, priority tagging, automatic replies, and calendar integration.

## Key Lessons

- Platform companies can reduce dependency on third-party integrations by building native solutions
- Expanding into adjacent productivity categories strengthens ecosystem stickiness
- AI integration across multiple tools enhances user workflow cohesion

**Tech Stack:** Gmail, Google Calendar, Slack, Google Drive
