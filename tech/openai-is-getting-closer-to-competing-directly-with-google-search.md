OpenAI has expanded its "search the web" feature to most paid users, enabling real-time internet connectivity within ChatGPT. The rollout includes Plus and Teams subscribers immediately, with Enterprise/Edu access coming within weeks and free users receiving access in coming months.

The platform introduced auto-complete suggestions for searches based on typed terms, currently available across all GPT models for logged-in users. These suggestions function independently of previous chat history and perform better with question-based queries than keywords, though they frequently stop after two to three words.

A globe icon in the chat interface provides access to the search feature, which displays trending topics like "Young Thug," "Thursday Night Football 2024," "Freddie Freeman," and "Trump Garbage Truck." The geographic basis for these trends remains unclear.

The search capability has notable limitations. When tested for "movie times Singapore," ChatGPT summarized cinema information rather than providing actual showtimes. However, it excels at explaining concepts and includes linked references for verification, resembling Google's Gemini AI summaries.

**Key Lessons:**
- Default placement drives adoption (Google's search dominance model referenced)
- User experience determines long-term viability
- Trust and accuracy are critical competitive advantages
- Specialized queries favor direct website visits over AI summaries
