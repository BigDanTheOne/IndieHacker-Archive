Gemma Vincent discusses leaving a toxic workplace to build an inclusive design agency (Pixelhop), then launching Chat Thing as a weekend project that became the primary business. Covers meeting co-founder husband Zef, traveling by camper van while building the company, and eventual settlement in Cornwall.

## Revenue Numbers

- Chat Thing MRR: Between $8K-$12K monthly
- Peak: Nearly $12K MRR
- Current: Flatlined at approximately $8K MRR

## Key Lessons

1. **Start lean and scrappy:** Validate ideas without perfecting all features upfront
2. **Prioritize marketing:** Competitors with inferior products outperformed them due to superior marketing
3. **Brand personality matters:** "Your branding doesn't have to be businessy or formal for you to be successful"
4. **Focus on user experience after proving concept:** Build minimum viable product first, refine onboarding later

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Nuxt
- AI Integration: Multi-provider support (OpenAI and competitors), function calling, SDK for custom Power-ups
- Data Sources: Notion pages, websites, YouTube, custom integrations
- Job/queuing system processing thousands of jobs daily with separated services for independent scaling
