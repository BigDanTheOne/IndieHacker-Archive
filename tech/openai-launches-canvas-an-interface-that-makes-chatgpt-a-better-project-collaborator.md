OpenAI has introduced Canvas, a new interface designed to enhance ChatGPT's collaborative capabilities for project work. The feature operates as a separate window alongside the standard ChatGPT interface, specifically built for collaborating on writing, editing, and coding projects.

Canvas allows users to highlight project sections and request AI assistance while making direct edits to documents or code. Writing features include requesting edits, adjusting length, modifying reading levels, and adding emojis. For developers, Canvas can review code, incorporate logs and comments, fix bugs, and convert code between programming languages like JavaScript and Python.

The functionality mirrors Anthropic's Artifacts feature but extends further by enabling more granular user control over document modifications. According to observer Dan Shipper, Canvas represents OpenAI's strategy to build a comprehensive operating system for the AI era.

However, critics including Ethan Mollick and David Cramer note that Canvas doesn't integrate seamlessly with existing workflows. Users typically write documents in Google Docs or Word, and code in VS Code. Competing products like Grammarly and Cursor succeed because they operate within users' current environments.

## Revenue Numbers
