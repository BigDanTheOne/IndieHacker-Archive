Anthropic released two new Claude 4 models designed for extended coding work. These systems can operate on intricate development tasks for hours, alternating between analytical reasoning and practical tool usage--a strategy differing from competitors' approaches.

Claude Opus 4 achieves 72.5% on the SWE-bench coding benchmark, while Claude Sonnet 4 reaches 72.7% on the same benchmark, priced at $3/$15 per million tokens. The previous generation (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) scored 63.7% on the same benchmark.

Despite enhanced capabilities, pricing remained constant: Opus 4 at $15 input / $75 output per million tokens, and Sonnet 4 at $3 input / $15 output per million tokens.

New features include extended thinking mode with user-controlled reasoning token budgets, Claude Code terminal assistant now generally available, and four fresh API capabilities for agent developers including code execution and expanded prompt caching (extending from 5 minutes to 1 hour).

The focus shifted from benchmark performance toward practical developer workflows, emphasizing real-world codebase management and multi-file operations over theoretical metrics.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Opus 4: $15 input / $75 output per million tokens
- Sonnet 4: $3 input / $15 output per million tokens

**Key Lessons:**
- Focus on practical developer workflows over benchmark performance
- Extended thinking mode with user-controlled reasoning token budgets enables complex tasks
- Real-world codebase management and multi-file operations matter more than theoretical metrics
