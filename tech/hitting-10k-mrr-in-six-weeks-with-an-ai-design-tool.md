Mattia Pomelli has spent eight years coding while maintaining a passion for design. He recognized that combining these interests into design tool development represented his optimal career intersection. Over the past year, working with two co-founders, he built four design tools before launching Sleek.design—an artificial intelligence application for mobile app design.

The market opportunity became apparent when Pomelli observed that mobile app design tools lag significantly behind web-based equivalents, despite growing demand. More individuals are building mobile applications without dedicated design resources or hiring capacity. Sleek addresses this gap by enabling app creators and developers lacking design expertise to "vibe design" beautiful applications through conversational AI interactions.

**Building and Launch Strategy**

Rather than starting from zero, Pomelli leveraged prior product development knowledge. He repurposed previous design tool code, enabling a complete version 1.0 launch within three weeks. The technical infrastructure includes Next.js, Supabase, Vercel, PostHog, Stripe, and Resend.

The X (formerly Twitter) launch employed strategic engagement mechanics. Pomelli crafted a compelling post with demonstration footage, requesting comments for early access. "The X algo loves comments. Valuable content + strong engagement = high chance of going viral." This approach generated significant initial traction.

Momentum continued through consistent, value-first content distribution. Rather than direct product promotion, Pomelli shared genuine design insights. He offered free initial designs to commenters requesting mobile app concepts, inviting paid upgrades for modifications and iterations. Some Instagram creators independently produced videos about Sleek without compensation, recognizing value for their audiences.

**Ideal Customer Profile Development**

Previous product ventures suffered from undefined target customers, resulting in unfocused feature development and unclear marketing positioning. With Sleek, Pomelli established a specific use case early: non-designer app founders and developers. This clarity streamlined messaging, feature prioritization, and channel selection.

**Monetization Approach**

Subscription pricing reflects different AI credit tiers. The free tier remains deliberately limited due to substantial AI computational expenses. Users generate one design free, then upgrade for modifications and additional creations. A $25 monthly subscription price point proved acceptable for serious builders recognizing potential savings of hundreds or thousands of dollars.

Pomelli experimented with localized pricing for Indonesian and African markets, implementing reduced-cost tiers reflecting different purchasing power. This optimization captured otherwise-lost revenue.

**Growth Drivers and Market Timing**

Pomelli emphasizes that successful products solve significant problems within expanding markets. Mobile app development represents an explosive market segment, with unprecedented numbers of non-technical individuals building applications. Rather than pushing the trend, Sleek facilitated it.

The revenue achievement—$10,000 monthly recurring revenue—occurred within six weeks without paid marketing expenditure.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $10,000 MRR within six weeks of launch
- $25 monthly subscription price point

**Key Lessons:**
- Speed over perfection: Launching MVP in three weeks enabled rapid market validation
- Narrow targeting wins: Defining specific ICP clarified all downstream decisions
- Limited free tiers filter quality customers
- Value-first content drives organic growth
- Market timing matters: Building in expanding categories accelerates adoption
- Reuse existing work: Leveraging previous product architecture compressed development timelines
- Platform mechanics drive virality: Understanding algorithm preferences outperforms broadcast messaging

**Tech Stack:**
Next.js, Supabase, Vercel, PostHog, Stripe, Resend
