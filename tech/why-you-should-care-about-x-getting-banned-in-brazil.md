Brazil has prohibited access to X after tensions escalated between platform owner Elon Musk and Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who sought authority to enforce content removal decisions. The standoff resulted in X's complete ban within the country.

Flanders contends founders should recognize this as a cautionary tale. He references allegations that the U.S. government "pressured Meta to censor Covid-19 content" and notes European officials calling for Musk's prosecution. The broader implication: platform bans could happen anywhere.

The article recommends three defensive strategies:
1. Establishing presence across multiple platforms (TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, Bluesky)
2. Building an owned audience through email newsletters
3. Diversifying marketing channels beyond social media to include SEO, cold outreach, and side projects

## Key Lessons

- Relying solely on any social platform creates existential business risk
- Email lists provide permanent audience access that social followers cannot
- Geographic precedent matters: if one nation bans a platform, others may follow
- Diversification across channels protects long-term marketing investments
