Bluesky achieved a significant milestone on November 15th by welcoming one million new users within a single 24-hour period. The platform, which launched publicly in February 2024 after an invite-only phase, now boasts over 16 million total users.

Bluesky originated in 2019 as a Twitter initiative under Jack Dorsey's leadership before becoming an independent venture in 2021, currently led by CEO Jay Graber. The platform resembles Twitter structurally with 256-character posts supporting media attachments. However, its distinguishing feature is the AT Protocol -- an open-source framework enabling transparency into platform mechanics and allowing users to create customized feeds tailored to individual preferences.

Engagement metrics suggest superiority over X. One user, Andrew Dessler, conducted a comparative experiment posting identical content across both platforms. His finding: Bluesky delivered approximately ten times the engagement per follower despite serving a smaller audience base.

Platform leadership attributes this success to exceptional user participation rates. According to Jay Graber, approximately 30% of active users post content, substantially surpassing the industry-standard 90-9-1 participation ratio typical of most platforms.

Growth drivers include X's Brazil ban, Threads moderation challenges, post-election user migration, and $15 million Series A funding (following an $8 million seed round in 2023).

**Key Lessons:**
- Decentralized, open-source protocols can attract users seeking data control and transparency
- Superior engagement metrics matter more than absolute user counts
- Network effects remain powerful but not insurmountable for well-positioned alternatives
- Meta's competitive responses validate emerging platform threats

**Tech Stack Mentioned:**
- AT Protocol (open-source decentralized framework)
