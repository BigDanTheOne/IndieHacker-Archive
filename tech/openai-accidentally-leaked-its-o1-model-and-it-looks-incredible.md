The piece describes how OpenAI's complete o1 model briefly became accessible after users changed a parameter in the URL during a two-hour window. The distinction between o1 and GPT centers on inference-focused versus data-focused approaches. Leaked demonstrations showed the model excelling at image puzzles and detailed visual analysis of a SpaceX rocket.

o1 improves through extended reasoning rather than data volume, unlike GPT models. The full o1 demonstrates "noticeable improvement" over the preview version. Multimodal capabilities enable sophisticated image interpretation and analysis.

CEO Sam Altman characterized the release timeline as bringing "AI fireworks" before year's end, with candidates including Orion or the full o1 model.
