## Founder: Nenad Milanovic
## Company: CAKE.com

Nenad Milanovic founded CAKE.com, a productivity suite generating over $25M annually. He spent a decade building side projects while running a consulting business to fund development without external capital.

## Products

- **Clockify** (2017): Time-tracking software for organizations
- **Pumble** (2020): Team communication and collaboration platform
- **Plaky** (2022): Project and task management tool

All products were built to solve internal company needs first. Clockify emerged when the company's existing time tracker raised prices. Development took three months with eight team members.

## Revenue Numbers

- Between $2M-$8M monthly ($25M+ annually)
- 96%+ gross margins
- 17,000 users within five days of launch
- One million registered users by 2019

## Key Lessons

1. **Build for yourself first** -- "products we build are all products that we use internally"
2. **Transparency drives trust** -- Honest pricing and clear communication attracted users organically
3. **Choose compatible distribution** -- Sales methods must align with founder personality and product type
4. **Patience matters** -- Ten years of iteration preceded major success
5. **Market selection is critical** -- Even perfect products fail in small markets
6. **Organic growth through SEO and content** -- Serious marketing efforts began only in 2021
7. **Underprice competition** -- Offer free features competitors charge for
