Building applications atop consumer-focused platforms carries substantial risk. The piece examines two recent API restrictions: Spotify revoked developer access to recommendation features (Audio Analysis API among them), citing AI training concerns. Instagram subsequently locked third-party consumer app developers out, discontinuing the Basic Display API as of December 4, 2024, requiring users to convert to business accounts for continued access.

The author contrasts this with B2B platforms like Shopify, which maintain thriving third-party developer ecosystems with profitable, long-standing apps. Shopify actively supports developers through feature releases and fee reductions on the first $1 million in revenue.

The fundamental difference lies in incentive alignment. B2B scenarios create mutual benefit between platforms and developers, whereas B2C arrangements often present conflicts where API access diminishes the platform's competitive advantage or revenue potential.

**Key Lessons:**
- B2C platform APIs face unpredictable access restrictions
- B2B platforms offer more sustainable developer partnerships
- Incentive alignment determines platform-developer relationships
