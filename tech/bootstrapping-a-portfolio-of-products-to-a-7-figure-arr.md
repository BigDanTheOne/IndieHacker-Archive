Andrian Valeanu, an entrepreneur from Moldova now based in Barcelona, shares his journey building a bootstrapped product portfolio generating over $83K monthly revenue (7-figure ARR).

Valeanu launched Designmodo as a blog in 2010. By 2011, his side income matched his salary, prompting a full-time transition.

**Current Product Ecosystem:**
- Designmodo (email builder with Postcards; website builders Slides and Startup)
- Siter.io (freehand, no-code website builder)
- Static.app (one-click static site hosting)
- Pulsetic.com (uptime monitoring with status badges and alerts)
- Unspam.email (email deliverability testing)
- Absurd.design (hand-drawn illustration project)

**Building Strategy:**
Selecting problems through content and freebies, shipping minimal viable slices, maintaining lean resources, using simple tech stacks, prioritizing clear design, starting free with low-entry paid tiers, and letting user behavior guide iterations.

**Major Crisis (2015-2017):**
Attempting WordPress ecosystem expansion through over-hiring and long build cycles created unsustainable burn. Recovery involved returning to core strengths, switching to subscriptions, reducing to three-person core team, and implementing strict spending discipline.

**Growth Channels:**
Free models enabling trial before payment, word-of-mouth from reliable features, SEO through practical guides, email marketing, and community engagement.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- >$83K/month (7-figure ARR)

**Key Lessons:**
- Crisis recovery demands rapid course correction toward core strengths
- "Process, resources, and decisions matter more than budgets"
- "Retention is usually the killer, if people don't return, nothing else matters"
- Educational growth combining content, SEO, and community outperforms paid advertising
- Nearly 15 years of consistent execution demonstrates compound growth
- Support interactions function as product intelligence directing feature development

**Tech Stack:**
TypeScript, React, Next.js (frontend), Laravel, Node.js, Go, Python (backend), PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Cloudflare, Postmark/Brevo (email), Pulsetic/Grafana (monitoring)
