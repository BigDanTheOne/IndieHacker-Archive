OpenAI released the "o1" model, a reasoning-focused AI system previously circulating under the codename "Strawberry." This represents OpenAI's new series of reasoning models designed for tackling complex problems.

OpenAI describes the approach: "We trained these models to spend more time thinking through problems before they respond, much like a person would." The training process teaches the models to refine their thinking, explore different strategies, and identify errors.

The model has been made available to all ChatGPT Plus subscribers.

## Key Lessons

- The o1 model demonstrates improved reasoning capabilities for mathematical and scientific problem-solving
- Extended "thinking time" before responding improves output quality
- The model can recognize and correct its own mistakes through training refinement

**Tech Stack:** ChatGPT Plus, ChatGPT 4o
