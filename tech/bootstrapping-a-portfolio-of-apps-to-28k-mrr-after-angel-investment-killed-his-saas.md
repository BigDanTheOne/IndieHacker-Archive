Sorin Alupoaie, founder of Swifteq, bootstrapped a portfolio of apps to $28k MRR after a failed angel-invested SaaS venture.

## Revenue Numbers

- Current MRR: EUR 26k (approximately $28k USD)
- Revenue more than doubled in last 12 months
- Gross last 12 months revenue nearly tripled
- Roughly 50% goes to expenses; remainder reinvested
- Target: EUR 1 million ARR

## Key Lessons

1. **Runway Matters:** Save approximately one year's salary before going full-time on a venture to protect family finances
2. **Pricing Strategy:** "Be careful with pricing. Many founders start out underpricing" which attracts wrong customers and diminishes perceived value. Start higher; adjusting downward is easier than raising prices later.
3. **Customer-Centric Development:** Prioritize features addressing common pain points rather than individual requests
4. **Balance Building with Marketing:** "Marketing is just as essential as the product itself -- perhaps even more so."
5. **Platform Diversification:** Reduce dependency risk by expanding beyond single platforms (Zendesk to Intercom, Freshdesk, Salesforce)
6. **Lean Launch:** Minimal scope allows rapid iteration -- the first app launched in under two weeks while working full-time

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js, MongoDB
- Additional: Python (data processing, automation)

## Business Model

Primarily subscription-based (monthly/annual plans) with added 30-day passes for short-term users, reducing churn from customers needing temporary access.
