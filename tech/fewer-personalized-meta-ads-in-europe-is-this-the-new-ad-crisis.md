Facebook and Instagram introduced a new less-targeted ad option for European users over 18. Users can now choose between: paying for an ad-free subscription, continuing with personalized ads, or selecting a new option with minimal targeting based only on age, location, gender, and recent app activity.

This regulatory response stems from an EU court ruling requiring explicit consent for personal data use in advertising. The company lowered subscription prices to 5.99 euros for web users (previously 9.99 euros) and 7.99 euros for mobile users.

The change affects all 27 EU member states plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.

**Revenue Numbers Mentioned:**
- "Every euro spent on Meta ads brings in 3.79 euros in revenue on average"
- Web subscription: 5.99 euros (reduced from 9.99 euros)
- Mobile subscription: 7.99 euros

**Key Lessons:**
- Small businesses heavily depend on personalized advertising for competitive advantage
- Regulatory pressure reshapes digital marketing strategies
- "Small businesses make up over 99% of all companies" in Europe and employ over 100 million people
- Less precise targeting may reduce advertising ROI
