Buster Benson launched 750 Words in 2009 as a private journaling platform encouraging users to write three pages of stream-of-consciousness daily. The product remained largely neglected for over a decade while he pursued other ventures at companies like Amazon, Twitter, Slack, and Medium. Despite minimal attention, the platform grew organically through word-of-mouth and search, eventually accumulating 920,000 signups and over 13 billion words written.

The business model evolved from free (2009) to donations-supported (2010) to membership-based (2014) with two tiers: $5/month standard and $10/month premium with AI features. The platform grants lifetime free accounts to 200,000+ users who joined before 2014.

Current metrics show approximately 5,800 paying members generating $26,000 monthly revenue. Traffic reaches 30,000-40,000 monthly visitors with 2,500 average signups (7% organic conversion, 9% from paid ads). First-month conversion sits at 1.5%, climbing to 6% by 90 days and stabilizing around 10% long-term. Subscriber churn averages 2.5% monthly with 80% year-one retention.

Benson rebuilt the entire platform in 2020 using Rails API backend with Vue frontend, recently upgrading to Vue 3 with AI-assisted development. The architecture prioritizes write-heavy database queries.

Community engagement runs deep: 470 users maintain 1,000+ day streaks, 197 exceed 2,000 days, and 68 surpass 3,000 consecutive writing days. The "Hall of Phoenixes" recognizes 100+ day achievers through community recognition.

Growth strategy for the next year focuses on four pillars: increasing SEO and answer engine optimization for LLM traffic, expanding paid advertising (Reddit showing strong initial results), launching structured writing courses, and maintaining existing user satisfaction through community-voted feature development.

Benson emphasizes staying independent to preserve intrinsic motivation. He resisted venture funding to avoid the pressure of forced growth that compromised other projects.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Current: $26,000/month
- Previous plateau: $20,000/month (2019-2024)
- Goal: $50,000/month within 12 months
- Last year growth: 25% increase ($21K to $25K)
- Paying members: 5,800
- Tier pricing: $5/month and $10/month

**Key Lessons:**
- Compounding persistence: Seventeen years of steady growth produced stronger results than aggressive early scaling
- Retention validates product: 80% annual retention on a $5 product signals genuine product-market fit
- Intrinsic motivation matters: Building for authentic human needs outperforms growth-at-all-costs approaches
- Independence preserves values: Avoiding VC prevented the "enshittification" trap
- Activation over acquisition: Converting existing non-paying users offers greater leverage than pure traffic growth
- Community builds loyalty: Users with 1,000+ day streaks demonstrate habit-forming design
