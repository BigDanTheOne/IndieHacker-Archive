Microsoft announced plans to make Visual Studio Code an open-source AI editor by open sourcing the GitHub Copilot Chat extension under the MIT license. The company will gradually refactor additional AI capabilities into VS Code's core and release its prompt testing infrastructure to the community.

The strategic approach maintains proprietary control where it matters most. While developers gain access to interface code, the underlying GitHub Copilot AI service itself will remain proprietary and subscription-based. This preserves Microsoft's revenue model while building developer goodwill.

The move addresses competitive pressure from AI-native editors. VS Code forks like Windsurf and Cursor have gained traction, but integrated native AI features may convince developers to remain within the ecosystem rather than experimenting elsewhere.

Changes will roll out within weeks, with a public product roadmap available on GitHub. The VS Code team committed to updating their FAQ addressing community questions about the initiative.

**Key Lessons:**
- Open sourcing interface code while keeping the AI service proprietary preserves revenue while building goodwill
- Competitive pressure from AI-native editors (Windsurf, Cursor) drives open source strategy
- Integrated native AI features may retain developers within the ecosystem
