The article challenges the narrative that Pieter Levels' viral AI flight simulator succeeded solely due to his 600K+ X followers. Evidence shows smaller creators achieved comparable viral success through strategic approaches.

## Featured Creators & Games

- Reagan Maconi (520 followers): Combat Mission (1.5K likes)
- Nicola Manzini (3,302 followers): Vibe Sail (1.6K likes)
- Nicolas Zullo (2,265 followers): WW2 Dogfight Arena (2.9K likes)
- Cemil Sevim (353 followers): Battle Tank (1.1K likes)
- Jay Codes (1,205 followers): Space Balls (2.2K likes)

## Key Lessons

1. **Quality Matters:** Successful games weren't low-quality experiments. Space Balls replicated Agar.io's proven mechanics; WW2 Dogfight Arena surpassed Levels' original flight sim, earning "Beautiful and way better" praise from Levels himself.

2. **Strategic Engagement:** Creators commented on viral posts to gain exposure, particularly piggybacking on Pieter Levels' frequent updates with competing products.

3. **Relentless Shipping:** Success required constant iteration and public updates. Nicola Manzini exemplified this, posting 20+ daily updates for weeks, including "not many updates" posts maintaining visibility.

4. **Channel Selection:** X proved optimal for reaching tech-savvy audiences primed for gaming and AI innovation.
