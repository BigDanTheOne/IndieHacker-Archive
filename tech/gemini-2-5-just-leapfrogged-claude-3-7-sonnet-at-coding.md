The piece examines why Google's newly released Gemini 2.5 model -- despite superior coding benchmarks -- hasn't captured developer attention the way competitors have.

## Main Arguments

1. **Performance Gap:** Early benchmarks indicate Gemini 2.5 outperforms Claude 3.7 Sonnet for coding tasks, yet remains overlooked in industry discourse.

2. **Attention Economy Loss:** OpenAI's new image generation model overshadowed Google's announcement in the news cycle.

3. **Two Critical Barriers:**
   - **Pricing:** The $20/month subscription feels prohibitive when combined with other AI tool costs
   - **Integration Issues:** Limited Cursor support and restrictive rate limits on the popular code editor hamper adoption

4. **Workaround Solution:** Google AI Studio provides free temporary access but lacks Cursor's organizational features like project management and "Project Rules."

## Key Takeaway

Google possesses technically superior technology but struggles with distribution friction and developer experience -- illustrating how "vibes" and accessibility now rival raw technical merit in capturing market share.
