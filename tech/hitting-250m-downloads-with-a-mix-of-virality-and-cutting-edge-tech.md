## Full Article

Dima Shvets recounts his journey from venture capitalist to founder of Reface, an AI-powered face-swap application. After five years running a seed-stage VC fund in Central/Eastern Europe, Shvets joined cofounders to build the first real-time, on-device face-swap technology using GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks).

## Key Lessons

1. **Organic growth over paid marketing:** "It's easy to grow vanity metrics with ad spend...If you only grow when you pay, chances are, you're just burning money."
2. **Viral mechanics matter:** Built-in watermarks, multi-face swaps, and culturally relevant content proved essential -- these weren't afterthoughts but core product features.
3. **Team quality over quantity:** "Hiring the wrong people costs you more than not hiring at all."
4. **Influencer strategy:** Rather than chasing A-list celebrities directly, the team targeted secondary celebrities and "tagged them relentlessly," creating organic adoption by major figures like Elon Musk and Snoop Dogg.
5. **Scaling infrastructure:** Successfully handled sudden viral spikes when major influencers shared content, requiring rapid backend optimization.

## Technology Stack

- **Core AI:** Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- **Focus:** Real-time facial feature mapping for seamless face swaps
- **Deployment:** On-device processing (lightweight ML models)
- **Product evolution:** Website -> GIF/video processing -> mobile app
