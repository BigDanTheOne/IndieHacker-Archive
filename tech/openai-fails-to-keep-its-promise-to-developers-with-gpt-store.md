OpenAI excluded numerous developers from its pilot monetization program despite their GPTs achieving millions of installations and featuring prominently on the store's homepage. According to Wired reporting cited in the piece, affected developers had to pursue alternative revenue strategies instead.

Excluded developers monetized through affiliate links, third-party networks, and by leveraging GPT traffic as acquisition channels for paid products.

## Key Lessons

- Developer platforms require transparent, inclusive monetization promises to maintain ecosystem trust
- High visibility on a platform does not guarantee inclusion in revenue-sharing initiatives
- Developers must diversify income streams when platform monetization proves unreliable

**Tech Stack:** GPT Store (OpenAI), Custom GPTs
