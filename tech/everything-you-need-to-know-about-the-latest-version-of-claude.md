Anthropic has released Claude 3.5 Sonnet with groundbreaking computer interaction capabilities. The model can now take screenshots, click, type, and perceive screens -- marking the first public release of an AI model with these abilities.

The new computer skills allow Claude to fill forms, search the web, create calendar events, plan routes, and write code directly in desktop editors. Developers can access these features via the Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud's Vertex AI. However, Anthropic acknowledges the technology remains experimental and error-prone, with challenges around scrolling, dragging, and zooming.

Beyond interface control, Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrates improved performance in reasoning, knowledge, and coding compared to GPT-4o and Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro. The model significantly lags on math problem-solving benchmarks. Anthropic also released Claude 3.5 Haiku with enhanced reasoning and coding abilities.

Pricing remains unchanged: Sonnet costs $3 per million input tokens with $15 per million output tokens, while Haiku costs $0.25 per million input tokens with $1.25 per million output tokens.

## Key Lessons

- Early-stage computer vision AI requires careful deployment on low-risk tasks
- Coding performance is a competitive advantage
- Pricing stability matters in adoption

**Tech Stack:** Claude API, Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI, VSCode
