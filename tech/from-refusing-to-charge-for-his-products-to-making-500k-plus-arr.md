Grant McConnaughey, founder of Postpone.

## Revenue Numbers
- Current: Mid-six-figure ARR (>$42K monthly)
- Affiliate revenue: Nearly $200,000 over several years
- Initial pricing: $3-$25/month; current plans: $25-$299/month

## Key Lessons

1. **Overcome monetization fears**: McConnaughey initially avoided charging due to anxiety about user expectations. His New Year's resolution to make "$1 online" forced infrastructure setup.

2. **Build for businesses, not consumers**: "Businesses will write you a monthly check for $200 without thinking. Consumers will spend $8 a day on Starbucks but won't spend $5 per month on an app."

3. **Focus features on growth metrics**: Only pursue projects answering yes to lead generation, trial signups, paid activations, expansions, or churn reduction.

4. **Mitigate platform risk**: When Reddit announced API charges, diversifying across 12 platforms became essential for survival.

5. **Price strategically**: Raised prices 20% in fall 2023 alongside new features; minimal signup impact.

6. **Customer-driven development**: "Customers pay because you deliver value to them, and value means solving their problems."
