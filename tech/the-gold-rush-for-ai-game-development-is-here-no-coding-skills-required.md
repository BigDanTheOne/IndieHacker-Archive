The piece chronicles a recent surge in AI-assisted game development among indie developers, sparked by Pieter Levels' viral flight simulator that generated $67K/month. The article highlights how tools like Claude, Cursor, and Three.js enable rapid prototyping -- with complete games shipping in 3-4 hours.

## Key Examples Featured

- **Reagan Maconi:** Multiplayer Battle Royale FPS built in ~4 hours, achieving 180K+ views
- **Alexandre Grisey:** 3D forest-escape game completed in 3 hours without writing code
- **Courtland Allen:** Created "Indie Mini" startup-themed crossword puzzle using Cursor and Claude
- **Nicola Manzini:** Sailing game gained 195K views despite starting with ~300 followers

## Revenue Data

Only one specific figure mentioned: Pieter Levels' flight simulator generated "$67K/mo"

## Key Lessons

1. **Accessibility democratizes creation:** Non-coders can now build functional, playable games
2. **Speed enables virality:** Quick prototyping allows for "building in public" momentum
3. **Novelty attracts audience:** Building publicly generates organic engagement, regardless of follower count
4. **Limitations acknowledged:** These are primarily "simple, unique ideas" rather than full-scope games

## Tech Stack

- **AI Models:** Claude, Grok, Claude Sonnet 3.7
- **IDEs/Editors:** Cursor, Cursor AI
- **Graphics:** Three.js
- **Development Approach:** Claude Code, vibe coding
