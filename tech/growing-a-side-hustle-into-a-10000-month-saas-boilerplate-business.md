Jonathan Wilke, 27, founder of Supastarter, grew a side hustle into a $10,000/month SaaS boilerplate business while working only 4-6 hours weekly on it.

## Revenue Numbers

- Initial goal: $1,000/month
- First milestone: $1,000 in 3 months (August 2021 launch)
- Current revenue: $10,000/month
- Time investment: 4-6 hours weekly
- Original pricing: $49; current pricing: $299

## Key Lessons

1. **Pricing matters significantly:** Wilke incrementally raised prices from $49 to $299, observing that "the higher I priced the product, the better it sold"
2. **Build for recurring customer needs:** The boilerplate originated from repetitive client work
3. **Prioritize product flexibility:** Customer feedback drove major rewrites and feature expansions
4. **Marketing challenges require persistence:** Initial sales came through X posts and Reddit
5. **Maintain work-life balance:** Wilke deliberately keeps Supastarter as a side project

The business model relies on one-time purchases rather than recurring revenue.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js, Nuxt, Sveltekit (upcoming), Supabase, Prisma, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, tRPC, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, shadcn UI
