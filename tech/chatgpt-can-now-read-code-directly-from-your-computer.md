OpenAI introduced a beta capability allowing ChatGPT's macOS desktop app to access code from linked development tools. The feature integrates with VSCode, XCode, TextEdit, iTerm, and Terminal, enabling the AI to analyze code without requiring manual copying and pasting.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Reads open editor panes and up to 200 terminal lines
- Focuses on selected text while maintaining broader context
- Provides copyable code suggestions
- Cannot yet edit code directly (in-development feature)

**Current Limitations:**
- Available only on macOS 14+ with M1+ processors
- Restricted to Plus and Team subscribers
- Education/Enterprise rollout delayed by weeks
- Windows version under development

**Key Lessons:**
1. The feature addresses workflow inefficiency by reducing manual code transfer
2. Privacy concerns exist regarding credential exposure and data storage
3. OpenAI's roadmap includes computer-using AI agents by January 2025
4. Voice-command coding is a future objective

**Tech Stack Mentioned:**
VSCode, XCode, TextEdit, iTerm, Terminal

**Data Storage Note:** Code data enters chat history and may train OpenAI models unless users disable model improvement settings.
