Connor Burd, an iOS app developer, built a mobile product portfolio that generates approximately $185,000 in monthly recurring revenue through subscription-based applications.

**Origin Story:**
Burd started by building apps out of curiosity, waking up with an idea and shipping it. Over time, this curiosity transformed into momentum, eventually becoming a serious business focused on consumer subscription apps.

**Key Business Approach:**
The independent app studio emphasizes strong distribution, clean execution, and data-driven iteration across all products.

**Product Focus:**
While managing multiple mobile products, Burd currently concentrates on Payout. He emphasizes committing fully to single projects, noting that focused attention dramatically improves decision quality and business understanding.

**Distribution Strategy:**
Rather than treating distribution as an afterthought, Burd prioritized it from day one. For Payout specifically:
- Researched TikTok and App Store trends extensively
- Partnered with an influencer with existing validated audience
- Built products around established audiences
- Grew through user-generated content and paid advertising
- Implemented strong App Store optimization
- Found influencer marketing most effective, delivering tens of millions of views

**Learning Approach:**
Each product taught lessons about distribution, retention, and positioning. Burd advocates doubling down early on proven signals rather than experimenting too broadly.

**Core Advice:**
"Build for distribution first." Partner with someone who already possesses an audience. If something works for someone else, that validates it can work for you.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $185,000 per month in MRR
- Tens of millions of views through influencer partnerships

**Key Lessons:**
- Curiosity-driven development can evolve into sustainable businesses
- Single-product focus improves decision-making significantly
- "Build for distribution first" rather than perfecting products beforehand
- Audience partnership validates demand before heavy development
- Double down early on working signals
- Tech stack consistency reduces variance and frees mental energy

**Tech Stack:**
Cursor, TypeScript, Next.js, Vercel, RevenueCat
