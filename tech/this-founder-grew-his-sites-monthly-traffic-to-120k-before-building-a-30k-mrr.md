Andrew Fennell launched a CV writing service that initially failed due to lack of traffic. Rather than rely on expensive Google Ads, he dedicated years to mastering SEO and building organic visibility.

Fennell transitioned through three business models—from services to advertising monetization to SaaS. He created an extensive resource library of CV advice articles that accumulated 18 million organic visitors. This foundation eventually supported the launch of StandOut CV, a resume builder application.

**SEO Strategy:**
- Produced in-depth, genuinely useful content addressing job seeker pain points
- Built topical authority through comprehensive guides on CVs, interviews, cover letters, and job search tactics
- Developed ethical link-building through guest posts, journalist outreach, and linkable assets
- Maintained solid technical infrastructure with fast load times and mobile optimization

**Content Scaling:**
Managing quality while publishing 20+ articles monthly required structured processes including detailed briefs, style guides, editorial reviews, and investment in quality writers.

**Product Development:**
After growing the website's audience, Fennell invested GBP 30,000 in agency-built CV builder software. The initial build required 6 months, followed by another 6 months of testing and refinement.

**Monetization Model:**
Users can access all features free until download. The paywall triggers only upon completion satisfaction. Initial pricing: GBP 2.70 for a two-week trial, then GBP 16.95 monthly subscription.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- GBP 30,000 MRR
- GBP 1 million total revenue since launch
- 23,000+ paying customers
- GBP 30,000 investment in initial product development

**Key Lessons:**
- "Build your audience first, then your product" -- only once you've validated commercial potential
- SEO remains viable: Organic traffic through quality content competes effectively against major brands
- Content quality at scale requires systems: briefs, editorial processes, quality writer investment
- Avoid building in high-churn segments where customer lifetime value suffers
- Paywall placement impacts conversion: Free access until satisfaction point reduces friction
- Long-term thinking wins: Ethical practices outperform shortcuts

**Tech Stack:**
WordPress with Kinsta hosting, WP Rocket, All-in-One SEO, Django with Python RESTful API (backend), Netlify (frontend)
