## Full Article

Lucie Baratte launched Logology in 2020 after observing that many startup founders lacked affordable professional branding solutions. The platform uses an AI-driven questionnaire to suggest from 700+ pre-designed logos, eliminating the need for expensive custom work.

She initially cofounded the company with her ex-husband (tech) and a friend (marketing). The team invested personal savings and freelance income during development. After cofounders departed due to burnout and differing visions, Baratte continued solo.

Currently, she sustains herself through diversified income: product revenue, teaching semiology, freelance design work, and novel writing. She dedicates roughly 3 days weekly to the startup, balancing multiple creative pursuits.

## Key Lessons

- "Surrounding yourself with inspiring, supportive, and kind people" proves essential during entrepreneurial challenges
- Naive optimism can be valuable but requires pragmatic planning regarding marketing and business sustainability
- Cofounders with unspoken differing expectations create significant friction
- Product perfection without communication strategy limits growth
- Solo operation allows reconnection with personal vision but increases workload
