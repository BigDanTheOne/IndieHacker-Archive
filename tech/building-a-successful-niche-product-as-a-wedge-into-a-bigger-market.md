Neel Bhattacharya, founder of TheSolarAI and LeadTrackAI, discovered a persistent business problem: companies lose customers due to slow response times. After 20 years in enterprise marketing automation (IBM Unica, Salesforce, Adobe Campaign), she observed that "Companies that responded fastest across voice + SMS + email won."

Working in Australia's solar sector, she noticed solar companies spent $50K+ monthly on ads but took 4+ hours to call leads back. She built TheSolarAI to respond to leads in under 60 seconds through voice + SMS + email orchestration, converting them into appointments.

The solar product serves as a wedge into LeadTrackAI, expanding the model across automotive, real estate, and home services.

**Business Model:** 100% performance-based pricing—clients pay zero upfront, earning commission only when leads convert to appointments. This approach removed buyer objections but created cash flow challenges during early months.

**Key Metrics:**
- ~$8K MRR
- 18-month average client retention
- 30-90% conversion rate improvements for clients
- Zero churn in past 5 months

**Revenue Numbers:**
- High 4-figure MRR (approximately $8,000/month)

**Key Lessons:**
- Domain expertise compounds: Deep industry knowledge provides competitive advantage over AI-first founders
- Solve persistent problems experienced for 5+ years, not newly discovered ones
- Niche strategy works: Dominating a focused market creates foundation for horizontal expansion
- Reliability over hype: Boring but proven tools outperform cutting-edge solutions in production
- Performance-based pricing aligns incentives and creates evangelical customers
- Relationships drive growth: 15-year professional network outperformed paid advertising
- Enterprise focus: Larger budgets justify longer sales cycles

**Tech Stack:**
OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo, ElevenLabs (voice), Deepgram (transcription), Twilio (calls/SMS), Python/FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS, Next.js/React, Salesforce/HubSpot/Pipedrive integrations. Initial MVP: GPT-4, Twilio, VPS, Google Sheets
