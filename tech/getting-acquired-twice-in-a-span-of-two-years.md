Alex Heiden shares his entrepreneurial journey of building multiple successful businesses and achieving two acquisitions within two years.

Heiden started his career in remote sales before founding Closify in January 2021, a hiring platform specializing in commission-only sales representatives. The platform generated over $1M in revenue, with peak monthly revenue of $125,000 in May 2022. He exited the majority stake in March 2023.

Following the Closify exit, Heiden grew to 100,000 Instagram followers in 95 days under the handle @nocode.alex and operated a no-code development agency generating $30-100K monthly from June 2023 through August 2024.

He launched Payd in February 2025, a platform connecting businesses with creators for sponsored content campaigns. The app reached six-figure run rate by March 2025. Payd's model charged $500/month plus 20% commission on brand budgets. Heiden was subsequently acqui-hired by Whop.
