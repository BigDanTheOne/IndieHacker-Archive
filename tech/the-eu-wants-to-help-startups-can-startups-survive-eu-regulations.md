The piece explores Europe's startup paradox: strong talent and investment growth alongside significant scaling challenges.

- **Investment Growth:** Europe shows 13% annual startup investment growth versus 8% in the US, with AI investment growing ninefold over a decade.

- **Scaling Problem:** EU Commission President von der Leyen stated: "We are roughly as good as the US at creating startups. But when it comes to scale-ups, we are doing much worse than our competitors."

- **Cultural Barriers:** Germany exhibits anti-entrepreneurship sentiment, with the observation that "America innovates, China imitates, Europe regulates."

- **Policy Challenges:** Norway's wealth tax on unrealized gains harms asset-rich, cash-poor founders. New EU data privacy rules reduce personalized ads, impacting SMB growth.

- **EU Initiatives:** Creation of first Startup Commissioner Ekaterina Zaharieva to cut bureaucracy; proposed European Savings and Investments Union.

- **Funding Gap:** EU invests 1.3% GDP in R&D versus US (2.4%) and China (1.9%).

**Revenue Numbers Mentioned:**
- Meta ads generate 3.79 euros in revenue per euro spent (European average)

**Key Lessons:**
1. Creating startups isn't Europe's weakness; scaling them is
2. Regulatory burden and cultural attitudes impede entrepreneurial ambition
3. Policy changes must move quickly to prevent talent migration to US/China
