## Revenue Numbers

- Current MRR: $12,000/month
- Ad Revenue: ~$700/month
- Monthly Visitors: ~100,000
- Growth Target: $50,000/month by year-end

## Key Lessons

1. **Solve Real Problems First** - The founders identified genuine gaps in existing mockup tools that were "limited, slow, and typically required Photoshop knowledge."

2. **Start Minimal and Validate** - They launched with only t-shirt mockups, taking roughly two months to master core functionality before expanding.

3. **Leverage Nights and Weekends** - Built the product while employed to minimize financial risk and validate demand before committing full-time.

4. **Prioritize User Experience** - Designed with "minimal cognitive load" and featured instant preview functionality.

5. **Freemium Model Effectiveness** - Implementing download limits (3 mockups daily for free users) triggered a "3x revenue increase."

6. **Community Distribution Over Viral Marketing** - Creating a free Figma resource proved more valuable than pursuing high-volume but irrelevant search terms.

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: Vue.js
- Backend: Node.js
- Bootstrap Status: Completely self-funded since 2021

Pranay Agarwal and Mofid Ansari developed Mockey, an AI-powered mockup generator, initially as a nights-and-weekends project while maintaining their day jobs. After identifying market inefficiencies, they built an MVP focused on t-shirt mockups with emphasis on user accessibility and browser-based functionality. Agarwal left his position in December 2023 to pursue the venture full-time.

The business originally relied on advertising alone ($700/month from 100K visitors). When subscriptions launched in April 2024, revenue surged to $12K monthly. The founders credit strategic SEO efforts, community engagement (particularly within design communities), and a balanced freemium model with download restrictions for their growth trajectory. They anticipate reaching $50K MRR by year-end 2025.
