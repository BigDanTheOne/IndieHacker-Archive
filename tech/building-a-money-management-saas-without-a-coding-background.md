Ben Waterman and Michael Magdongon founded Strabo, a money management SaaS, without coding backgrounds. They started with Bubble (no-code) and later transitioned to a professional tech stack.

## Revenue Numbers

- Current MRR: $1,000/month
- 1,100 monthly active users
- Average user login frequency: 3 times per month (targeting weekly engagement)
- Connected to 10,000 financial institutions across 12 countries

## Key Lessons

1. **Hire a trustworthy in-house CTO** rather than relying on outsourced developers: "Outsourced developers are never going to put the same care into the product as you would."
2. No-code tools enable non-technical founders to launch viable products before scaling with professional teams
3. User feedback drives iteration more than theoretical planning
4. Launch early and publicly rather than perfecting before release
5. Combine B2C and B2B strategies simultaneously to diversify revenue
6. Persistence through self-doubt remains essential

**Tech Stack:** Bubble (initial), Node.js (backend), React (frontend), AWS (serverless architecture)
