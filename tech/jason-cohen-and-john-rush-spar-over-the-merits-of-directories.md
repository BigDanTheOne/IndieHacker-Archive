Jason Cohen, founder of two unicorns, publicly questioned the directory-building trend on X, stating: "Please, no more directories. Build something valuable that people want to pay for because it's valuable."

The article explains that directories are currently popular because Google has become less useful due to AI-generated content. This has created demand for curated resources listing landing pages, NoCode tools, AI tools, and language tools.

For indie hackers, directories offer advantages: they're simple to build using AI and no-code tools, help validate ideas while generating traffic, and can produce side income.

John Rush, self-described "Directory King," countered that directories serve strategic purposes. He argued the real value lies in creating traffic flow, validating audiences, and using directories as stepping stones toward developing micro-tools and SaaS products.

Cohen remained skeptical, emphasizing that "99% of websites are bad" because websites require minimal effort to build. Software products, requiring substantial development effort, maintain higher quality standards.

The article references a similar industry debate when Product Hunt's CEO defended removing low-effort products like directories and landing page analyzers from prominence.

**Key Lessons:**
- Low-effort products flood markets due to accessibility
- Directory value depends on curation quality and audience targeting
- Directories can function as validation mechanisms for larger business ideas
- Quality differentiates successful projects from trendy failures
