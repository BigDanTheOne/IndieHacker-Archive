Lukas Hermann built Stagetimer, a web-based timer application for live events, video production, and presentations. The product allows speakers and event organizers to display synchronized countdowns on remote devices via browser, serving clients from small producers to enterprises like Microsoft and IKEA.

Hermann recorded ideas for two years before selecting the simplest one to develop. While visiting a friend's video studio, he observed the inefficiency of manually starting timers across rooms. He developed the initial version in a single weekend using technologies he already knew. The MVP was deliberately basic: click start on one device, timer counts down on another via shared link.

Finding users proved more challenging than coding. Hermann spent considerable time identifying r/CommercialAV on Reddit as his target community through a Reddit mapping tool. Community feedback validated the concept and generated feature requests.

The business faced significant churn—approximately 12% monthly—because customers subscribed for single events then canceled. Hermann introduced "event licenses": one-time 30-day purchases without auto-renewal, priced roughly double the monthly rate. This reduced churn to approximately 3%.

Free users see the Stagetimer logo prominently—functioning as free advertising at every event where deployed.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $3,000/month when transitioning to full-time
- $20,000/month (current)
- $500,000 acquisition offer (rejected)

**Key Lessons:**
- Select the simplest idea, not the most exciting
- Build and ship quickly without premium polish
- Identify niche communities where target users congregate
- Align pricing with actual customer behavior patterns
- Implement product-led growth through visible branding
- Focus on solving one problem deeply before expanding

**Tech Stack:**
Vue.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB
