The article profiles Rik Schennink, founder of Pintura, a web-based image editor. Schennink transitioned from full-time agency work to indie hacking, initially building an iOS game, then web components on Envato before launching Pintura independently in 2018.

Schennink gradually reduced his day job from 40 to 32 hours while building products, eventually quitting to freelance part-time. He operates subscription-based licensing for Pintura with perpetual software access.

His strategy involves creating complementary free tools (FilePond, edit.photo, edit.video, redact.photo, new.photo) that drive traffic to paid products. He emphasizes focusing on his core "Why": proving web applications can match native experiences.

Key operational decisions include avoiding competitor analysis, writing most code manually rather than relying on AI generation, and publishing SEO-focused blog content.

## Revenue Numbers

- CropGuide: $1K/month
- BananaBin: ~$1K/month or slightly less

## Key Lessons

1. "Finish something" -- too many indie hackers don't publish their work
2. Focus on your product's core value proposition rather than competition
3. Build high-quality free complementary products that genuinely offer value
4. Write your own code; AI-generated code becomes difficult to maintain
5. Gradual transition from employment to self-employment is viable
