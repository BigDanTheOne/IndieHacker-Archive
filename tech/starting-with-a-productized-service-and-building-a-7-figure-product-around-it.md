Craig Hewitt launched Podcast Motor as a productized service after his second child was born, seeking an escape from corporate employment. This service provided done-for-you podcast editing and production, generating steady income while funding future development.

A customer referral led Hewitt to acquire a free WordPress plugin called Seriously Simple Podcasting. He then built Castos as a hosting platform integrating with WordPress, allowing podcasters to publish to major platforms like Apple Podcasts and Spotify while accessing analytics and monetization tools.

Initial product development required four months. Hewitt partnered with a developer recommended by the plugin's original creator. Rather than cold outreach, Hewitt leveraged an email list built through content marketing at Podcast Motor. The launch included free plugin updates featuring contextual calls-to-action directing users toward paid hosting features like advanced analytics and monetization options.

Revenue shifted significantly over time--SaaS now comprises 80% of total income, demonstrating successful transition from service to product-based business. Hewitt notes that building seven-figure businesses around low-price offerings is substantially harder than serving fewer clients at premium rates, requiring massive customer acquisition and minimal churn.

He advocates for bootstrapping through services: "If you have the team and the systems done right, then it doesn't really require a lot of your time." This model sustained him while building the SaaS product.

Hewitt credits podcasts (Pat Flynn, Rob Walling, Dan and Ian of Tropical MBA) as foundational learning tools and now emphasizes YouTube and business literature.
