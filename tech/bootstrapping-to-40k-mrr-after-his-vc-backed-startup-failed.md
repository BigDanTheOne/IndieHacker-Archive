Alex Rainey transitioned from corporate consulting at Accenture into startup founding. His first venture, Pluto (a travel-insurance startup), reached #2 on Trustpilot before collapsing during the COVID-19 pandemic. After experimenting with several micro-SaaS products, he co-founded My AskAI in early 2023 with Mike Heap.

My AskAI enables companies to create and deploy AI-powered customer support agents that integrate with existing support platforms like Intercom and Zendesk. The product allows businesses to upload content, then customers can ask questions and receive AI-generated answers sourced from that content.

The opportunity emerged when OpenAI launched its new embedding models, enabling users to search through and chat with large datasets. Rainey was motivated to bootstrap after becoming a father, preferring flexibility over pursuing additional venture capital.

The first working MVP launched in three weeks with minimal investment (under $1,000) using Bubble and OpenAI, funded by revenue from earlier projects. The team consists of just two people: Rainey handling product development and Mike Heap handling customer interviews and growth testing.

Early on, the team suffered from shiny-object syndrome, experimenting with every new AI capability rather than focusing on core objectives. They also positioned too broadly as "chat with anything" before pivoting to customer support after 12 months. Infrastructure scaling issues caused significant outages on Bubble before upgrading to Enterprise tier.

Primary growth driver is Google/SEO through specific, consistent messaging emphasizing value ("5x cheaper than Intercom's Fin or Zendesk's AI"). Secondary approaches include onboarding calls with serious prospects and small-scale paid advertising experiments. Rainey notes that "growth is messy" due to long decision-making cycles (2-4 weeks before conversion) and poor attribution tracking.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $40,000 MRR
- ~$500,000 ARR
- 75,000+ monthly support chats handled
- 82% gross margin
- Churn reduced from 9% to 3%
- Reached $10k MRR in month 4
- Target: $1M ARR

**Key Lessons:**
- Pre-sell or prototype publicly before extensive coding
- Treat constraints as forcing mechanisms for focus
- Prioritize retained, paying customers over vanity metrics
- Minimize social media distraction while sharing product updates consistently
- Treat support interactions as public marketing opportunities
- No-code remains viable despite AI coding tools

**Tech Stack:**
Bubble (~80% frontend/workflows), Python (backend), OpenAI, AWS, Notion, Slack, Cursor, ChatGPT
