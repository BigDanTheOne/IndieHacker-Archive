Ilya Novohatskyi was laid off during COVID while studying Software Engineering at KPI in Kyiv. Rather than seek traditional employment, he co-founded Quanti Coders, an outsourcing agency focused on building web and mobile applications. Starting with just $500, he and a former sales manager colleague built the agency to $15,000/month revenue within two years.

By year two, Novohatskyi identified a gap: no quality platform existed for founders to sell their applications. He developed Microns, an M&A marketplace for digital projects. Working nights and weekends initially, Microns eventually became his primary focus.

**Building Microns:**
The marketplace was built entirely using no-code tools. The first MVP launched with $5,000 invested. Initially free for nine months, Microns introduced buyer memberships ($40/month or $299/year) and seller success fees (6-10% depending on deal size).

Over four years, Microns has facilitated over 100 founder transactions totaling more than $500,000 in deals. The platform now hosts 10,000+ registered users and 160+ active listings.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Quanti Coders: $15,000/month
- Microns: $9,000/month (commission on deals)
- Microns Historical: $28K (2022), $40K (2023), $58K (2024)
- Combined: $24,000/month

**Key Lessons:**
- "Never give up, no matter the conditions"
- Listen directly to users; don't pursue external validation
- Start small and validate before scaling
- Outsourcing businesses require linear growth tied to headcount; marketplaces enable exponential compounding growth
- Consistency in content, email, and community engagement compounds over years

**Tech Stack:**
Webflow (frontend), Wized (API/logic), Xano (backend/database), Google Cloud (storage), Google Apps Script (contract automation). Entire marketplace built without custom development.
