## Founder: Kushank Aggarwal
## Products: Prompt-Genie, Map-This, Looplytic

## Key Revenue Numbers

- **Total Monthly Revenue:** $30k-$35k
- **Revenue Split:** ~50% from products, ~50% from content/brand partnerships
- **Prompt-Genie:** Peak of $10k/mo after launch; currently contributing to portfolio
- **Map-This:** $8k/mo
- **Looplytic:** Recently launched MVP with growing customer base

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Node
- **Infrastructure:** AWS
- **Initial Development:** No-code tools (first version of Prompt-Genie)

## Key Lessons

1. **Build personal brand before products.** Aggarwal emphasizes: "There are no shortcuts to building a personal brand, it is simply being yourself."
2. **Identify your leverage.** Whether through personal brand, connections, or niche skills, leverage is essential for zero-cost user acquisition.
3. **Content-driven growth works.** Social media marketing (TikTok, Instagram) and AI-generated user content proved most effective for user acquisition.
4. **Pricing optimization matters.** Removing credit card requirements for trials reduced churn; tiered pricing ($9-$9.99) balances conversion with revenue.
5. **Speed and focus prevent failure.** Testing MVP in 4 days and pivoting within 14 days demonstrated agility; conversely, lack of focus led to revenue decline.
6. **Consolidate before expanding.** Future strategy prioritizes optimizing existing products over launching new ones.
