Balaji Srinivasan, former Coinbase CTO and a16z general partner, is launching the "Network School" on a private island near Singapore. The initiative targets what he calls "dark talent" -- individuals facing disadvantaged circumstances or those misaligned with establishment institutions.

The curriculum encompasses tech entrepreneurship, covering crypto, AI, social media, history, politics, and filmmaking. Students receive personalized nutrition and fitness plans designed by longevity expert Bryan Johnson. The school awards cryptocurrency prizes for completed open-source projects, AI content creation, and microtasks.

Pricing starts at $2,000 monthly individually or $1,000 with roommates. The concept enjoys support among prominent technologists including Marc Andreessen, Vitalik Buterin, and Peter Thiel.
