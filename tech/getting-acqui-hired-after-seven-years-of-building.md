Alex Lashkov built Linguix, an AI writing assistant, over nearly seven years before achieving an acqui-hire by a unicorn company. The founder invested personal savings and balanced multiple responsibilities while competing against well-funded competitors.

Lashkov previously ran a content marketing agency serving international clients. He recognized a gap: "The only option for maintaining copy quality back then was Grammarly, which could not (and still can't) work with multiple languages." This sparked Linguix before ChatGPT existed.

Lashkov spent approximately $30,000 of personal savings on initial development and marketing while maintaining his first business. He raised $1.35M from investors during the company's lifecycle.

Facing competition from "unicorn-level competitors that dominate every marketing channel," Lashkov employed non-paid acquisition strategies including SEO, content marketing, community engagement on Reddit/Quora, AppSumo partnerships, and affiliate programs.

The startup initially launched as B2C freemium SaaS but eventually shifted toward SMB B2B customers and developer-focused products like grammar-check APIs.

Finding a buyer proved difficult; "cold outreach is what brought in our buyer." The acquisition followed Google's model with Windsurf, where the acquiring company bought out both technical cofounders.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Monthly revenue: >$14,000
- ARR at acquisition: ~$170,000
- Initial personal investment: ~$30,000
- Outside funding raised: $1.35M

**Key Lessons:**
- Long-term persistence matters: Seven years of consistent effort led to successful exit
- Agility beats capital: Smaller teams can pivot faster than well-funded competitors
- Non-paid channels work: SEO, content marketing, and community engagement generated significant user acquisition
- B2B focus recommended from inception rather than starting with B2C
- Financial contributions should correlate with equity stakes
- Founders should personally manage exit negotiations
- Cold outreach ultimately secured the acquisition
