Colin Gray's journey from astrophysics through content creation to building Alitu, a podcast production SaaS. He built ThePodcastHost.com as a content site, grew it through SEO, then identified the pain point of podcast editing and production complexity. Alitu simplifies podcast production through automation and opinionated design choices.

## Key Lessons

1. **Opinionated Product Design:** Constraints and automation reduce user overwhelm more effectively than extensive feature sets
2. **Content-Driven Growth:** SEO content, affiliate partnerships, YouTube, podcasting, and email remain viable despite AI emergence
3. **Small, Fast Development:** Break projects into sub-24-hour tasks; longer estimates contain excessive uncertainty
4. **Simple Pricing:** No free tier, short trials (7 days), justified premium pricing from launch
5. **Controllable Metrics:** Set goals around activities (blog posts, videos, customer service ratings) rather than arbitrary revenue targets

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Node.js
- Frontend: React
- Infrastructure: AWS
- Key Challenge: Building accurate browser-based audio editing and managing continuous call recording without deployment downtime
