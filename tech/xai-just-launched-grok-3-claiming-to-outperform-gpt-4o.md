xAI, Elon Musk's AI company, unveiled Grok 3, featuring "10x more computing power than its predecessor." The model includes DeepSearch, an agentic research tool analyzing internet and X content. Early access goes to X Premium+ subscribers ($50/month).

## Key Features

- Grok 3 and Grok 3 mini with enhanced reasoning
- DeepSearch for research analysis
- "Think" and "Big Brain" modes for complex queries
- Voice mode launching within a week
- Enterprise API expected in weeks

The company trained Grok 3 using approximately 200,000 GPUs and claims it outperforms GPT-4o on mathematics and PhD-level science benchmarks.

## Revenue Numbers

- X Premium+ subscription: $50/month
- Planned SuperGrok tier: $30/month or $300/year

## Key Lessons for Indie Hackers

1. Leverage DeepSearch for social listening and market research applications
2. Sign up for enterprise API waitlist to access enhanced reasoning capabilities
3. Consider X platform integration advantages and risks before building dependent products

## Risks Highlighted

- Enterprise API pricing undisclosed
- Heavy reliance on X platform creates vulnerability to platform unpredictability

## Tech Stack Mentioned

- Grok 3 AI model
- DeepSearch feature
- xAI's Memphis data center (200,000 GPUs)
- GPT-4o (comparison baseline)
