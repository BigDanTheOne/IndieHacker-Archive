Rick van Haasteren built SiteGuru, an SEO tool designed to simplify ranking in Google for non-experts. He started developing it as an internal tool while working as an SEO consultant, then transformed it into a full product during the pandemic when he went all-in.

Initially, SiteGuru was just an audit tool helping Rick identify main website issues without sifting through hundreds of reports. As he used it on client projects, he refined the product based on real-world feedback. When he quit his consulting job to focus fulltime, development accelerated significantly.

The product evolved beyond basic auditing. Today it pulls data from Google and other providers to deliver comprehensive insights, using AI to generate SEO-consultant-style recommendations.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $14,000 MRR

**Key Lessons:**
- "Watch some screen recordings of your onboarding and see how your users go through it. You'll feel their pain" -- transformative for identifying UX friction
- Niche differentiation: Most SEO tools target professionals; SiteGuru focused on general marketers
- Dogfooding value: Performing client work using your own product generates authentic feature ideas
- Lifetime deals done right: Limited LTDs with stackable codes excluding high-cost features create sustainable revenue
- Content takes time: Organic SEO growth requires patience; earlier influencer outreach could have helped

**Tech Stack:**
Laravel Vapor, AWS, legacy PHP framework (frontend)
