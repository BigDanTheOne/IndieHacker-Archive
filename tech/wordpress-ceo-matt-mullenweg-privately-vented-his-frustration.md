The article reports on WordPress CEO Matt Mullenweg's private frustration following a preliminary court injunction against Automattic (which owns WordPress.com). The court order required the company to reverse several actions taken during their dispute with WP Engine.

According to 404 Media, which obtained screenshots of now-deleted Slack messages, Mullenweg expressed: "It's hard to imagine wanting to continue to working on WordPress after this. I'm sick and disgusted to be legally compelled to provide free labor to an organization as parasitic and exploitive as WP Engine."

**Key Lessons:**
1. GPL licensing implications in open-source projects create ongoing governance challenges
2. Legal disputes can significantly impact founder morale in tech organizations
3. The WordPress ecosystem faces tensions between commercial interests and open-source principles

**Tech Stack Mentioned:**

- WordPress.com
- Automattic (company)
