Richard Wang, founder of Leadmore AI and ModelFox AI, shared his journey building AI-powered marketing products. He emphasized validating ideas through user research and content before writing code, rather than defaulting to immediate development.

**His process involves four steps:** Starting with insights into real user needs observed on social media; validating ideas through operations and content demonstrations to check if potential customers show genuine interest; conducting 50-100 user conversations to understand pain points before building; and finally shipping a minimal viable product quickly.

Wang uses a credit-based business model where users purchase credits for actions like posting and discovering subreddits, with unused credits refundable anytime. He prioritizes retention over acquisition, noting that strong retention indicates real product value.

Wang stressed fighting the urge to expand features unnecessarily, particularly when operating with a small team. He believes reducing his initial MVP from three features to just one would have enabled faster shipping.

Growth came primarily through content marketing and relationship building, especially on Reddit, combined with direct conversations with engaged users. This approach proved more sustainable than broad marketing tactics.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- $30,000+ MRR for Leadmore AI
- $8,000 in revenue generated by a new unreleased product using MVP approach

**Key Lessons:**
- Validate demand extensively before coding: Spend 1-3 months researching users
- Maintain minimal MVPs: "If one feature is enough, don't build two."
- Prioritize retention metrics: new users x conversion rate x retention rate
- Fight feature expansion impulses: Small teams cannot execute multiple features well simultaneously
- Use niche-specific growth channels: Content-driven growth on matching platforms compounds better
- Operations and distribution skills matter: "Operational ability can be more important than pure development skills"
- Avoid trend-chasing: Understand personal industry strengths and iterate consistently

**Tech Stack:**
Next.js, Go with Gin framework, MongoDB, ClickHouse (analytics), Function Compute (serverless). ~80-90% built using AI development tools.
