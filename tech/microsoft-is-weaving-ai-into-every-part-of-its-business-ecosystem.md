Microsoft is integrating AI across its enterprise software portfolio, with "85% of the Fortune 500 are using Microsoft's AI services in some form." The company expanded Copilot Studio access to approximately 1,800 large language models through Azure AI. Over 100,000 organizations have adopted Copilot Studio for automating business processes. New integrations enable real-time data access from CRM systems like Salesforce and Zendesk.

Key features include Copilot Studio's new voice generation, image analysis capabilities, and access to diverse language models. Two new development options -- Power Apps agent builder and a Microsoft 365 Agents SDK -- offer varied control levels. The Azure AI Foundry consolidates these tools into one unified platform accessible through SDKs, GitHub, VSCode, or a visual portal.
