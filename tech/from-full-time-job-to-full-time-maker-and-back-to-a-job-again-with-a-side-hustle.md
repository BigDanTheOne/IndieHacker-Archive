Mattia Righetti, an indie maker from Italy with a background in IT and graphic design, shares his journey through various entrepreneurial ventures. He initially worked as a freelance marketer for six years before attempting to build products online.

His early attempts included info products on Twitter (generating approximately $2.5k before burnout), a newsletter with sponsorships, and an AI tool that made roughly $1k before discontinuation.

In 2024, Righetti co-founded BlackTwist, a management tool for Threads creators addressing the gap left by Meta's inadequate native analytics. The problem emerged from personal frustration.

**Pre-Launch Validation Strategy:**
The team validated demand through a pre-sale approach. Results: 120 subscribers on the waiting list, 70%+ average open rate across all emails, 18 early lifetime deals plus 1 agency plan, 38 customers total, $3.7k in pre-sales.

**Key Decision:**
When offered a Product Manager position, Righetti accepted it, removing financial pressure. This decision proved strategic, as revenue doubled afterward.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Info products: $2.5k total
- AI tool: $1k total
- BlackTwist pre-sales: $3.7k
- Current BlackTwist MRR: $2k
- Goal: $5k MRR short-term, $500k ARR within 2-3 years

**Key Lessons:**
- "You can build the best product ever, but if nobody sees it, it doesn't matter" -- distribution over perfection
- "Every single call, DM, or email has taught me something that moved the product forward"
- "You'll learn more from ten real users than from ten days of planning"
- Building in public involves sharing progress, failures, and maintaining community engagement
- Accepting employment with entrepreneurial ambitions is pragmatic: removing financial stress enables better product development

**Tech Stack:**
