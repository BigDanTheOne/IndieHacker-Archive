U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has appointed venture capitalist David Sacks, 52, as his artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar. Sacks will advise on making America "the clear global leader" in both sectors while combating "Big Tech bias and censorship."

Sacks is a former PayPal COO who founded Yammer (sold to Microsoft for $1.2 billion in 2012) and co-founded venture capital firm Craft Ventures in 2017. He has invested in at least 20 unicorn companies including Airbnb, SpaceX, and Twitter. He co-hosts the podcast "All In."

His responsibilities will include establishing a legal cryptocurrency framework and leading the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology. Trump plans to repeal Biden's 2023 AI executive order, replacing it with policies supporting "AI development rooted in free speech."

Sacks believes artificial intelligence could be "bigger than the internet itself."

**Key Lessons:** Crypto-friendly policy approach expected; lighter regulatory touch anticipated for AI development
