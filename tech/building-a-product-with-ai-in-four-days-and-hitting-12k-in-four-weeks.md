## Founder: Sebastian Volkis
## Product: TrendFeed

## Revenue Numbers

- **TrendFeed:** $12k in first four weeks; £9,222 ($12k USD) total revenue
- **Launch day revenue:** £5,500 ($7,150 USD) from 22 lifetime deal customers
- **CodeSpring:** $45k since January
- **Combined monthly:** $29k/month across ventures
- **ChatIQ:** Reached £7.5k ($9.7k USD) MRR in first two months

## Key Lessons

1. **Control the Sales Process:** Webinar funnels convert significantly better than passive landing pages. The controlled approach yielded £5,500 from 250 leads versus traditional SaaS models generating only £40/month from comparable traffic.
2. **Focus on Distribution Over Perfection:** "Seventy percent of your time should be spent on marketing and sales." Product doesn't need polish at launch; traction matters more.
3. **Build for Existing Audiences:** Sebastian spent two years building 50k Instagram, 30k TikTok, and 4k YouTube followers before launching TrendFeed, enabling initial success.
4. **Content Sells Offers, Not Products:** Avoid ad-like promotional content. Instead, "entertain. Add controversy. Hook people with a problem, then sell them on a lead magnet."
5. **Secure AI-Generated Code:** Despite rapid development, invest 20-40% of time on security measures and proper code architecture to prevent production failures.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, ShadCN (UI components)
- **Backend:** Supabase (database)
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Authentication:** Clerk (planned)
- **Payments:** Whop (planned)
- **Development Tool:** Cursor (AI coding assistant)
- **Previous platform:** Bubble (no-code)

## Background

Sebastian's journey included failed ventures (dropshipping, YouTube tutorials, freelance media buying) before discovering Bubble and building ChatIQ. He partnered with his twin brother Matthew (marketing) to build TrendFeed -- a tool aggregating viral news and programmatically generating short-form video content for Instagram and TikTok creators.

The MVP launched February 27, 2025, after four days of AI-assisted development. The team intentionally operates in closed beta via webinar funnel to control conversion rates, with plans to eventually release free tier and scale through influencer partnerships and paid advertising.
