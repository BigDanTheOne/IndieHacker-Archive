This is an Indie Hackers exclusive article for IH+ subscribers. The guide presents "vibe coding tips for avoiding headaches in Cursor and becoming your own game studio." The tips cover project setup, game design strategies, technical tools, and deployment methods.

## Development Workflow Tips (1-12)

- Use project planning with ChatGPT o1-pro or Grok 3 before coding
- Set up Project Rules in Cursor for consistent AI behavior
- Generate multiple initial versions and select the best
- Commit frequently for rollback capability
- Use images in prompts for complex mechanics

## Game Design Ideas

- Copycat versions of popular games
- Educational games
- Controversial/timely topics
- Board game adaptations

## 3D Development Tools

- Three.js for 3D graphics
- Trellis for character generation
- Mixamo for animations
- Sketchfab for environment models
- AmmoJS or CannonJS for physics

## Audio & Voice

- Suno for background music generation
- Tone.js for sound effects
- ElevenLabs for voice synthesis

## Mobile & Multiplayer

- nippleJS for virtual joysticks
- Python WebSockets for multiplayer functionality
- WebRTC alternatives for networking

## Deployment & Growth

- HuggingFace Spaces for free hosting
- Portal features linking to other games
- X/Twitter engagement for feature decisions
- Featurebase for user voting on roadmap

## Key Lessons

1. **Planning reduces errors:** "Vibe project management" can reduce "AI hallucinations and assumptions by 85%"
2. **Tool selection matters:** Different game types require different frameworks (ThreeJS for 3D, Vue.js for 2D)
3. **Version control is essential:** Frequent commits prevent lengthy debugging sessions
4. **Collaboration amplifies reach:** Portal features and cross-promotion between indie developers increase traction
5. **Marketing is the bottleneck:** "building is the easy part" but "getting noticed by enough people to seed initial traction is basically the hard part"
