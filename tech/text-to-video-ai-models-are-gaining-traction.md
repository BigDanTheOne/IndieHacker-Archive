The piece discusses the emergence of text-to-video AI technologies as a dominant trend in 2024. While 2023 focused on text-to-text models, the current year is characterized by video generation tools.

Key developments:
- PyramidFlow launched a new text-to-video AI model capable of producing 5-10 second videos at 768p resolution and 24fps
- Meta released its own text-to-video AI model

Notable independent developers are capitalizing on this technology -- specifically Tibo's Revid product and Levelsio's integration of video generation into his photo AI tool.

## Key Lessons

- Emerging AI technologies create business opportunities for indie developers
- Text-to-video represents the evolution of generative AI from text-only capabilities
- Early adoption by entrepreneurs can position them competitively
