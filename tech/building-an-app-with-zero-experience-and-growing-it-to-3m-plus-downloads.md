Ania Wysocka created Rootd after experiencing her first panic attack while studying away from home. Unable to find helpful resources, she spent years researching clinical papers and expert conversations before deciding to build the app she wished existed.

Starting with zero technical background, Wysocka designed all wireframes and content herself while collaborating with a student React Native developer. The team later transitioned to Flutter. The initial MVP featured just two core functions: a panic button and lessons section, with careful attention paid to copy tone, color selection, and the app's mascot character Ron.

Rootd now includes a panic button and guided breathing exercises, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) lessons, guided visualizations and sleep stories, and journaling tools. The app operates on a freemium model with free core features and optional monthly, annual, or lifetime subscriptions. B2B expansion includes licensing to organizations for employee wellness programs.

Growth channels include App Store Optimization (ASO) through meticulous metadata refinement, organic discovery via app store features, podcast interviews and press coverage, and word-of-mouth recommendations. The app has been featured in Healthline, Cosmopolitan, TIME magazine, and both Apple and Google Play stores. It is available in 12 languages across 150+ countries.

Wysocka personally reads every user review, treating them as the "heartbeat" of product development. She credits entrepreneur networks, founder circles, and programs like the Cartier Women's Initiative as crucial support systems.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Revenue exceeded $10K monthly
- Reached five-figure monthly recurring revenue by 2021
- 3+ million downloads across 150+ countries
- Available in 12 languages
- Target: 10 million users within three years

**Key Lessons:**
- "Pick a problem you care deeply about, focus obsessively on solving it"
- Launch imperfect MVPs: an incomplete product still helped users
- Bootstrapping from inception forced clarity and user alignment
- Personally read every user review as the "heartbeat" of product development
- Entrepreneur networks and founder circles provide crucial support

**Tech Stack:**
React Native (initial), Flutter (current)
