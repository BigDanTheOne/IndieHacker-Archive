Kevin Wagstaff transitioned from finance and corporate work into entrepreneurship. He taught himself SEO to enter tech, worked at HomeAdvisor/Angie's List while holding a real estate license, then launched Spectora with his brother in 2017—an all-in-one home inspection software platform.

The founding approach centered on customer research. The team purchased Starbucks gift cards to interview home inspectors about pain points and existing software preferences. They built an MVP using Rails and Vue, investing $2,500 each for AWS hosting and domain registration.

Growth strategies emphasized community presence and content creation. The founders showed up daily in Facebook groups answering questions and engaging authentically for years. They begged for beta testers, offered introductory pricing for feedback, and rapidly iterated based on inspector workflows.

Wagstaff emphasizes that obscurity was their biggest early challenge, overcome through consistent community engagement, prolific content creation, and demonstrated commitment to customer improvement. Growth pillars included Facebook group participation, word-of-mouth driven by exceptional chat support, SEO investment, and conference attendance.

On work-life balance, Wagstaff states: "I did not expect or want work-life balance. I knew what I signed up for and what was required for this business to grow!" He credits his athletics background with enabling sustained focus and competitive drive.

Revenue growth utilized a SaaS plus usage model. Expansion occurred through moving upmarket to enterprise clients, introducing advanced product suites, and adding payments as a revenue stream. The company prioritized consistency across team and product as the foundation for maintaining competitive advantage.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Current ARR: $30 million
- Monthly revenue: $2.5 million
- Projected 2026 ending ARR: $40 million
- 2023 valuation at partial sale: $90 million
- 2024 valuation at secondary sale: $110 million
- Founder's current stake: 12%

**Key Lessons:**
- "Launch and ship early and often" with rapid feedback iteration
- "Treat every single lead/tester/customer like they'll be your only customer"
- Focus on closing the loop with all stakeholders
- Formalize sales processes and CAC/ACV metrics sooner
- Implement automated testing earlier to prevent business-critical outages
- Build depth in a single niche rather than constantly pivoting
- Consistency in community engagement compounds over years

**Tech Stack:**
Rails, Vue, AWS
