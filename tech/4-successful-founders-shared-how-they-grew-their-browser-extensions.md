The piece summarizes growth strategies from bootstrapped founders discussed on Hacker News. Four main approaches are highlighted:

1. **Viral social media:** An unexpected TikTok video about an extension generated approximately 34,000 users without direct promotion from the creator.

2. **Multi-platform distribution:** Publishing on Microsoft Edge's addon store yielded roughly 40% of the Chrome store user count, requiring minimal modifications since Edge uses Chromium technology.

3. **Community engagement:** Targeted Reddit posts in developer-focused communities (r/webdev showoff Saturdays) helped one founder build four extensions with 1,000+ users each, including one exceeding 100,000 users.

4. **App store optimization:** Keyword optimization in extension store listings drives discovery, particularly for problem-solving tools, with related extension recommendations shown on listing pages.

**Key Lessons:**
- Social platforms can provide unexpected organic reach
- Cross-platform publishing extends audience reach efficiently
- Niche community engagement outperforms traditional marketing
- Store metadata optimization matters for discoverability
