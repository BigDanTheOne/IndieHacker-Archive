According to reporting by The Information, OpenAI is exploring development of a web browser that would integrate ChatGPT functionality. The publication claims the company has consulted with major firms including Redfin, Conde Nast, Priceline, and Eventbrite to "power search features for travel, food, real estate and retail websites."

"Nobody has really shaken up the consumer browser market since Google released Chrome in 2008," with Chrome currently commanding approximately 65% market share. OpenAI has previously introduced live internet search capabilities for ChatGPT and discussed AI technology partnerships with Samsung.

The timing coincides with Department of Justice monopoly proceedings against Google, where prosecutors have proposed Chrome divestment. The article describes the browser project as being in early stages and "not 'remotely close' to a launch."

**Key Lessons:**
- AI-powered search interfaces represent potential market disruption
- Integration of AI assistants into core browsing tools could shift user behavior from searching to conversational queries
- Strategic partnerships with content providers may be necessary for competitive browser launches

**Tech Stack Mentioned:**
- ChatGPT
- Android operating system
- Samsung devices
