Rich Watson, a former machinist, founded NVSTly after recovering from a broken jaw sustained in a 2020 road rage incident. During recovery amid pandemic lockdowns, he observed retail investors sharing trading signals on Discord without transparent performance tracking.

He identified the gap: "traders and influencers were sharing trade signals and analysis on social media and Discord, but there was no way to verify performance or track results transparently." This insight led to NVSTly, a Discord-integrated platform enabling traders to share, track, and copy trades with detailed analytics.

Watson initially struggled finding developers. After parting with several partners, he engaged a backend developer who completed a functional prototype in three weeks, including a Discord bot tracking trade signals, web app integration, trader leaderboards, and performance dashboards. Watson later discovered this developer was 14 years old when development began.

NVSTly operates as a freemium model. The platform automatically tracks shared trade signals, displays win rates, average gains/losses, and ranks traders globally. It supports stocks, options, crypto, and forex.

Growth occurred organically through Discord communities. Watson explains: "Building directly within the communities we serve has been a huge advantage." Users added the bot to their communities; other members witnessed its utility and adopted it, creating viral expansion loops. Bot listing sites like Top.gg facilitated discovery.

Verified traders monetize by setting subscription rates for followers receiving real-time trade notifications and automated copy-trading across brokerages.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- 5-figure MRR (>$10,000/month)
- Increased by nearly 50% in the last year and a half

**Key Lessons:**
- Avoid heavily regulated financial data sectors when bootstrapping; compliance costs prove prohibitive
- Find a cofounder offering complementary skills; disagreement strengthens decision-making
- Build products addressing genuine problems you'd want solved
- Ship early, iterate publicly, and resist perfectionism
- Establish products within existing communities rather than pulling users to new platforms
- Focus on transparency and accountability to build long-term trust

**Tech Stack:**
TypeScript, Node, Svelte(kit), Discord.JS, MongoDB
