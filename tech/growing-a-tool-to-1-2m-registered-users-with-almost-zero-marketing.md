Gokul Chandrasekaran founded JDoodle in 2013 as a side project with the mission of making software development accessible to everyone, particularly those without reliable computer access. Growing up in rural South India with limited computing resources, he experienced firsthand the barriers to learning programming.

JDoodle began as a one-page application where users could write Java code and receive immediate execution results. The founder launched with a $20 virtual server investment and minimal marketing—just ten forum posts and an existing Java blog with fifteen articles. The platform expanded organically through word-of-mouth as users requested additional programming languages and features.

The tool eventually attracted 1.2 million registered users and served over 20 million people. Only after securing funding two years ago did Chandrasekaran transition to full-time development and begin active marketing efforts including social media and newsletter advertising.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Over $10,000 monthly revenue
- Six-figure annual revenue achieved years ago
- Growth trajectory toward eight-figure revenue targets
- Initial business model used advertisements to cover costs

**Key Lessons:**
- Build solutions addressing genuine problems rather than pursuing multiple mediocre ideas
- Validate feature requests through revenue impact, not just user demand
- Maintain hands-on technical involvement to preserve competitive advantages
- Start with minimal viable products requiring minimal capital
- Let product quality drive organic user acquisition
- Design freemium subscription models replacing ad-supported approaches

**Tech Stack:**
Vue.js (frontend), Java/Spring (backend), Python/FastAPI (backend), microservices architecture. Previously: Grails/Groovy
