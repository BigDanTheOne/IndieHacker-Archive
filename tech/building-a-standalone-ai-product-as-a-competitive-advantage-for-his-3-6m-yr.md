Daniel Dunose spent 18+ years in market research before launching DataDiggers in 2015. The company generates $3.6M in annual revenue through digital market research services.

In August 2023, Dunose co-founded Brainactive, an AI-powered research technology platform that "automates the entire process of market research, from objectives to final report, with assistance from conversational and generative AI." The platform operates on a SaaS model with four subscription tiers, supplemented by audience sales and human-assisted services.

DataDiggers bootstrapped with minimal funding, with founders reinvesting all revenue for 1.5 years. Dunose personally handled initial website development, accounting, marketing, and HR functions.

Brainactive followed a different approach, combining expertise in market research, sales, technology, AI, and design. The team bootstrapped until MVP readiness (10 months), then secured friends-and-family funding. They received a $325,000 Google Cloud credit grant and are currently pursuing a pre-seed round.

**Revenue Numbers:**
- DataDiggers: $3.6M annually (~$300K monthly)
- Brainactive: Currently pre-revenue
- Google grant: $325,000 in credits

**Key Lessons:**
- Entrepreneurship demands resilience, willingness to work hard without clear positive outcome, stubbornness to continuously educate yourself, humility to learn from mistakes, and courage to take risks
- Solve "real" problems, preferably ones personally witnessed, that are sufficiently "large enough" to sustain a business
- Brainactive targets $100M revenue within 10 years

**Tech Stack Mentioned:**
- Conversational AI
- Generative AI
- Google Cloud (hosting and AI services)
- SaaS platform architecture
